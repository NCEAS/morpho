               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

        <descgeog help="A geographic extent description is especially important when the 
               extent of the data set is not well described by the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates", or in the case of data which 
               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"
               can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a 
               country, with this "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" element 
               containing a disclaimer concerning the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" and/or further detail concerning
               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a 
               specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon 
               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs 
               from the standard data element "Place_Keyword" in that it allows 
               a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than 
               just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location

          stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in 
          geologic studies often tie relative times measured through 
          stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time 
          using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these 
          methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the 
          dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be 
          inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative
          dates were measured. This structure is provided as an optional 
          alternative to the standard calendar dates provided by ISO 8601.">

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a

               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon

               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

          in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or 
          stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in 
          geologic studies often tie relative times measured through 
          stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time 
          using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these 
          methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the 
          dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be 
          inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative
          dates were measured. This structure is provided as an optional

      <descgeog help="A geographic extent description is especially important when the 
               extent of the data set is not well described by the

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a

               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"
               can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a

               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"
               can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a

               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a

               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and

               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but

               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

          the ISO 8601 dating system used in the standard CSDGM are not

          time is usually measured in  millions of years  before present, 
          but may use different units and relative base times. Relative 
          geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth s geology
          in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or 
          stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in 
          geologic studies often tie relative times measured through 
          stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time 
          using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these 
          methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the 
          dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be 
          inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative

    <descgeog help="A geographic extent description is especially important when the 
               extent of the data set is not well described by the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates", or in the case of data which 
               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"
               can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a 
               country, with this "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" element 
               containing a disclaimer concerning the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" and/or further detail concerning
               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a 
               specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon 
               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs 
               from the standard data element "Place_Keyword" in that it allows 
               a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than 
               just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and

               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact

               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a 
               specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon 
               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs 
               from the standard data element "Place_Keyword" in that it allows 
               a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than

          in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or 
          stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in 
          geologic studies often tie relative times measured through 
          stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time 
          using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these 
          methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the 
          dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be 
          inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative
          dates were measured. This structure is provided as an optional

          the ISO 8601 dating system used in the standard CSDGM are not 
          adequate to describe geologic time periods. Absolute geologic 
          time is usually measured in  millions of years  before present, 
          but may use different units and relative base times. Relative 
          geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth s geology
          in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or 
          stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in 
          geologic studies often tie relative times measured through 
          stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time 
          using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these 
          methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the 
          dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be 
          inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative
          dates were measured. This structure is provided as an optional

               extent of the data set is not well described by the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates", or in the case of data which 
               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"
               can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a 
               country, with this "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" element 
               containing a disclaimer concerning the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" and/or further detail concerning
               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a 
               specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon 
               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs 
               from the standard data element "Place_Keyword" in that it allows 
               a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than 
               just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location 
               names associated with the data set.">

          geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth s geology
          in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or 
          stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in

          stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time

          geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth s geology
          in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or 
          stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in

          stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time

  <descgeog help="A geographic extent description is especially important when the 
               extent of the data set is not well described by the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates", or in the case of data which 
               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"
               can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a

               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a

               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting

               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"

               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact

               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs

  <descgeog help="A geographic extent description is especially important when the 
               extent of the data set is not well described by the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates", or in the case of data which 
               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"
               can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a 
               country, with this "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" element 
               containing a disclaimer concerning the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" and/or further detail concerning
               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a 
               specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon 
               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs 
               from the standard data element "Place_Keyword" in that it allows 
               a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than 
               just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location 
               names associated with the data set.">

               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates"
               can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a 
               country, with this "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" element 
               containing a disclaimer concerning the 
               "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" and/or further detail concerning
               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a 
               specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon 
               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the "Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates" might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the "Description_of_Geographic_Extent" might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs 
               from the standard data element "Place_Keyword" in that it allows 
               a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than 
               just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location 
               names associated with the data set.">
