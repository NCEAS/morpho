This is used instead of duplicating information when an identical piece of information needs to be used multiple times in an EML document. For example, if the same person is the creator, metadataProvider, and contact for a dataset, their name and address can be provided once as part of the 'creator' element, and then their 'id' can be used in the 'references' element of  metadataProvider and contact. This reduces the likelihood of error by reducing redundancy, and allows one to specify that two pieces of information are identical. To be a vaild EML document, the content of every 'references' element MUST be defined in the document as the value of an 'id' attribute on some element within the document. Other critical rules about the use of IDs and references in EML are provided in the text of the EML specification.">

Note that this field, used in conjunction with 'organizationName' and 'individualName' make up a single logical originator. Because of this, an originator with only the individualName of 'Joe Smith' is NOT the same as an originator with the name of 'Joe Smith' and the organizationName of 'NSF'. Also, the positionName should not be used in conjunction with individualName unless only that individual at that position would be considered an originator for the data package. If a positionName is used in conjunction with an organizationName, then that implies that any person who currently occupies said positionName at organizationName is the originator of the data package.">

DateTime is used when the values fall on the Gregorian calendar system. DateTime values are special because the have properties of interval values (most of the time it is legitimate to treat them as interval values by converting them to a duration from a fixed point) but they sometimes only behave as ordinals (because the calendar is not predetermined, for some dateTime values one can only find out the order of the points and not the magnitude of the duration  between those points). Thus, the dateTime scale provides the information necessary to properly understand and parse date and time values without improperly  labeling them under one of the more traditional scales. Date and time values are unlike any other measured values.  Note that the dateTime field would not be used if one is recording time durations. In that case, one should use a standard unit such as seconds, nominalMinute or nominalDay, or a customUnit that defines the unit in terms of its relationship to SI second.">

								<formatString minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" help="A format string that describes the format for a dateTime value from the Gregorian calendar. DateTime values should be expressed in a format that conforms to the ISO 8601 standard. This field allows one to specify the format string that should be used to decode the date or time value. To describe the format of an attribute containing dateTime values, construct a string representation of the format using the following symbols:  Y year M month W month abbreviation (e.g., JAN) D day h hour m minute s second T time designator (demarcates date and time parts of date-time) Z UTC designator, indicating value is in UTC time . indicates a decimal fraction of a unit +/- indicates a positive or negative number, or a positive or negative time zone adjustment relative to UTC - indicates a separator between date components A/P am or pm designator  Any other character in the format string is interpreted as a separator character. Here are some examples of the format strings that can be constructed.  Format string Example value ------------------- ------------------ ISO Date YYYY-MM-DD 2002-10-14 ISO Datetime YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss 2002-10-14T09:13:45 ISO Time hh:mm:ss 17:13:45 ISO Time hh:mm:ss.sss 09:13:45.432 ISO Time hh:mm.mm 09:13.42 Non-standard DD/MM/YYYY 14/10/2002 Non-standard MM/DD/YYYY 10/14/2002 Non-standard MM/DD/YY 10/14/02 Non-standard YYYY-WWW-DD 2002-OCT-14 Non-standard YYYYWWWDD 2002OCT14 Non-standard YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss 2002-10-14 09:13:45  Some notes about these examples. First, the ISO 8601 standard is strict about the order of date components and the separators that are legal. Best practice is to follow the ISO 8601 format precisely. However, we recognize that existing data contain non-standard dates, and existing equipment (e.g., sensors) may still be producing non-standard dates. Consequently, we have provided the formatting string with additional characters to describe the date formats. In particular note that the use of a slash (/) to separate date components, a space to separate date and time components, using a twelve-hour time with am/pm designator, and placing any of the components out of descending order is non-standard according to ISO. Nevertheless, these formats can be described using the format string to accommodate existing data Decimal dateTime values can be extended by indicating in the format that additional decimals can be used. Only the final unit (e.g., seconds in a time value) can use the extended digits according to the ISO 8601 standard. For example, to show indicate that seconds are represented to the nearest 1/1000 of a second, the format string would be 'hh:mm:ss.sss'. Note that this only indicates the number of decimals used to record the value, and not the precision of the measurement (see dateTimePrecision for that).  Date and time values are from an interval scale, but it is extremely complex because of the vagaries of the calendar (e.g., leap years, and leap seconds). The duration between date and time values in the future is not even deterministic because leap seconds are based on current measurements of the earth's orbit. Consequently, date and time values are unlike any other measured values. The format string for dateTime values allows one to accurately calculate the duration in SI second units between two measured dateTime values, assuming that the conversion software has a detailed knowledge of the Gregorian calendar.

Thus, a precision value of '0.01' would mean that measurements were precise to the nearest hundredth of a second, even though the format string might indicate that values were written down with 3 decimal places.">

As line delimeters are often non-printing characters, one can use either the special value '\n' to represent a linefeed (ASCII 0x0a) and '\r' to represent a carriage return (ASCII 0x0d). Alternatively, one can use the hex value to represent character values (e.g., 0x0a).
