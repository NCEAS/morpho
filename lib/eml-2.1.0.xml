Assuming the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' do not adequately describe the extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and described in this data element. If the item being documented is not specifically geospatial, the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a country, with this 'Description_of_Geographic_Extent' element containing a disclaimer concerning the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' and/or further detail concerning the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon states, thus the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' might form a general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but the 'Description_of_Geographic_Extent' might describe the fact that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only certain rivers within those states. This data element differs from the standard data element 'Place_Keyword' in that it allows a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location names associated with the data set.">

This field is intended to describe which institution or overall organization is associated with the resource being described. Note that this field, used in conjunction with 'individualName' and 'positionName' make up a single logical originator. Because of this, an originator with only the individualName of 'Joe Smith' is NOT the same as an originator with the name of 'Joe Smith' and the organizationName of 'NSF'. Also, the positionName should not be used in conjunction with individualName unless only that individual at that position would be considered an originator for the data package. If a positionName is used in conjunction with an organizationName, then that implies that any person who currently occupies said positionName at organizationName is the originator of the data package.">
