  * Ecological Metadata Language is a general purpose metadata content
  * specification for documenting ecological data.  The specification 
  * consists of a series of modular document type definitions (DTD) that 
  * provide metadata content descriptors. It describes the owner and  
  * contents of the dataset  (eml-dataset.dtd), the research context in 
  * which it was created (eml-context.dtd), the structural 
  * characteristics of data files (eml-file.dtd), the 
  * characteristics of variables in a file (eml-variable.dtd), current 
  * status of data and metadata files (eml-status.dtd), access control 
  * rules regarding the data  and metadata (eml-access.dtd), software 
  * information (eml-software) and a variety of miscellaneous 
  * supplemental descriptors (eml-supplement.dtd).
  * 
  * Files generated under the structural constraints of eml are
  * plain-text files and therefore are editable in ordinary
  * text-processors.  However, these DTDs are intended for use within 
  * general purpose metadata editors, and within a more specific 
  * metadata editor being developed at NCEAS for the ecological 
  * community.  This metadata editor will provide facilities for 
  * version control and efficient metadata entry.  
  * The purpose of this specification was to formalize the 
  * Michener et al. work in a structured language to examine its 
  * application to ecological data in a controlled manner.
  *
  * This specification was based on the work of the Ecological Society 
  * of America's Committee on the Future of Long Term Data, and more
  * specifically on a related paper, Michener et al., 1997. See:
  * Michener, William K., et al., 1997. Ecological Appications,
  * "Nongeospatial metadata for the ecological sciences"
  * Vol 7(1). pp. 330-342.
  *
  * Where appropriate, we have used elements of the ISO/TC 211 draft 
  * standard - the ISO Geographic information/Geomatics standard, 
  * which includes xml code, as well as ISO 8601 schema. Some elements 
  * in the ISO/TC 211 were expanded to allow for greater 
  * resolution.
  *
  * For an explanation of the classes of metadata and elements defined 
  * below, see Michener et al. 1997. In particular, the numbered comment 
  * labels found below refer to Table 1 (pp. 336-337) of Michener 
  * et al. 1997. In addition, each of the principal elements in the 
  * specification is accompanied by a FIXED attribute called "description"
  * that provides a brief description of the content of the element. These
  * descriptions are derived from Michener et al. 1997.
