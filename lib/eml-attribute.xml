    <attributeName minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1" help="This element specifies name of the attribute (field)  in the dataset. This information is typically used as a column header for the field/variable in a spreadsheet. It is usually terse, without spaces, and can be used to 'name' a column in a table definition statement.">

If the pattern field is empty or missing, it  defaults to '.*', which matches any string, including the empty string. Repeated pattern elements are combined using logical OR.
