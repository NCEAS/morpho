Assuming the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' do not adequately describe the extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and described in this data element. If the item being documented is not specifically geospatial, the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a country, with this 'Description_of_Geographic_Extent' element containing a disclaimer concerning the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' and/or further detail concerning the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon states, thus the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' might form a general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but the 'Description_of_Geographic_Extent' might describe the fact that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only certain rivers within those states. This data element differs from the standard data element 'Place_Keyword' in that it allows a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location names associated with the data set.">

Relative geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth's geology. in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in geologic studies often tie relative times measured through stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time using radioisotope dating techniques, among others.

Ratio is used for data which consists not only of equidistant points but also has a meaningful zero point, which allows ratios to have meaning. An example of a ratio scale would be the Kelvin temperature scale (200K is half as hot as 400K), and length in meters (e.g., 10 meters is twice as long as 5 meters).">

The recommended format for EML is hh:mm:ssTZD, where hh is the two digit hour of the day, mm is the two digit minute of the hour, and ss is the two digit second of the minute. TZD stands for Time Zone Designator which is used to handle time zone offsets. Times may be expressed in two ways: 1) UTC (Coordinated Universal Time, also known as Greenwich Mean Time, or GMT), with a special UTC designator ('Z'), 2) local time, together with a time zone offset in hours and minutes. A time zone offset of '+hh:mm' indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone which is 'hh' hours and 'mm' minutes ahead of UTC. A time zone offset of '-hh:mm' indicates that the date/time uses a local time zone which is 'hh' hours and 'mm' minutes behind UTC.">

Absolute geologic time is usually measured in millions of years before present, but may use different units and relative base times. Relative geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth's geology. in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in geologic studies often tie relative times measured through stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative dates were measured.

Assuming the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' do not adequately describe the extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and described in this data element. If the item being documented is not specifically geospatial, the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a country, with this 'Description_of_Geographic_Extent' element containing a disclaimer concerning the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' and/or further detail concerning the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon states, thus the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' might form a general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but the 'Description_of_Geographic_Extent' might describe the fact that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only certain rivers within those states. This data element differs from the standard data element 'Place_Keyword' in that it allows a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location names associated with the data set.">
