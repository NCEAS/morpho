  help="A geographic extent description is especially important when the extent of the data set is not well described by the &quot;Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates&quot;, or in the case of data which are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting for the item being documented. Assuming the &quot;Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates&quot; do not adequately describe the extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and described in this data element. If the item being documented is not specifically geospatial, the &quot;Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates&quot; can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a country, with this &quot;Description_of_Geographic_Extent&quot; element containing a disclaimer concerning the &quot;Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates&quot; and/or further detail concerning the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon states, thus the &quot;Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates&quot; might form a general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but the &quot;Description_of_Geographic_Extent&quot; might describe the fact that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only certain rivers within those states. This data element differs from the standard data element &quot;Place_Keyword&quot; in that it allows a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than just a list of words or phrases useful as an index of location names associated with the data set.">
