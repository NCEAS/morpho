Absolute geologic time is usually measured in millions of years before present, but may use different units and relative base times. Relative geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth's geology. in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in geologic studies often tie relative times measured through stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative dates were measured.

Absolute geologic time is usually measured in millions of years before present, but may use different units and relative base times. Relative geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth's geology. in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in geologic studies often tie relative times measured through stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative dates were measured.

The record delimiter is usually a linefeed (\n) on UNIX, a carriage return (\r) on MacOS, or both (\r\n) on Windows/DOS. Multiline records are usually delimited with two line ending characters, for example on UNIX it would be two linefeed characters (\n\n). As record delimeters are often non-printing characters, one can use either the special value '\n' to represent a linefeed (ASCII 0x0a) and '\r' to represent a carriage return (ASCII 0x0d). Alternatively, one can use the hex value to represent character values (e.g., 0x0a).">
