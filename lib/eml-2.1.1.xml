The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.  However support for international names is under consideration for a future version of  EML, along with other internationalization features. ">

Absolute geologic time is usually measured in millions of years before present, but may use different units and relative base times. Relative geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth's geology. in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in geologic studies often tie relative times measured through stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative dates were measured.

The two elements, &lt;givenName> and &lt;surName>, allow parsing of many types of names, even though distinct elements  do not exist for concepts like 'middle name' and 'compound surname'. &lt;givenName> should be used for parts of the name that are often shortened to a first initial, or are not used for ordering, and typically includes first and middle names. The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.  However support for international names is under consideration for a future version of  EML, along with other internationalization features. ">

This means that a parent element (e.g., creator) may use combinations of the 3 sub-elements  to make up a single logical party. For example, a creator with only the individualName of 'Joe Smith' is NOT the same as a creator with the individualName of 'Joe Smith' and the organizationName of 'NSF'. To include both a positionName and an organizationName as children of a &lt;contact> implies that anyone  currently occupying that positionName at that organizationName  is an appropriate contact. The positionName should not be used in conjunction with individualName unless only that specific individual at that position would be considered appropriate for that designation. ">

It uses these three subfields to help parse the person's entire name. The two elements, &lt;givenName> and &lt;surName>, allow parsing of many types of names, even though distinct elements  do not exist for concepts like 'middle name' and 'compound surname'. &lt;givenName> should be used for parts of the name that are often shortened to a first initial, or are not used for ordering, and typically includes first and middle names. The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.  However support for international names is under consideration for a future version of  EML, along with other internationalization features. ">

The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.

The two elements, &lt;givenName> and &lt;surName>, allow parsing of many types of names, even though distinct elements  do not exist for concepts like 'middle name' and 'compound surname'. &lt;givenName> should be used for parts of the name that are often shortened to a first initial, or are not used for ordering, and typically includes first and middle names. The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.  However support for international names is under consideration for a future version of  EML, along with other internationalization features. ">

It uses these three subfields to help parse the person's entire name. The two elements, &lt;givenName> and &lt;surName>, allow parsing of many types of names, even though distinct elements  do not exist for concepts like 'middle name' and 'compound surname'. &lt;givenName> should be used for parts of the name that are often shortened to a first initial, or are not used for ordering, and typically includes first and middle names. The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.  However support for international names is under consideration for a future version of  EML, along with other internationalization features. ">

The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.  However support for international names is under consideration for a future version of  EML, along with other internationalization features. ">

It uses these three subfields to help parse the person's entire name. The two elements, &lt;givenName> and &lt;surName>, allow parsing of many types of names, even though distinct elements  do not exist for concepts like 'middle name' and 'compound surname'. &lt;givenName> should be used for parts of the name that are often shortened to a first initial, or are not used for ordering, and typically includes first and middle names. The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.

If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose.

If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose.

For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose.

The two elements, &lt;givenName> and &lt;surName>, allow parsing of many types of names, even though distinct elements  do not exist for concepts like 'middle name' and 'compound surname'. &lt;givenName> should be used for parts of the name that are often shortened to a first initial, or are not used for ordering, and typically includes first and middle names. The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.  However support for international names is under consideration for a future version of  EML, along with other internationalization features. ">

The &lt;surName> field is intended to be used for the part of the name that is generally displayed in its entirety and/or is alphabetized or otherwise ordered when appropriate. Note that only one &lt;surName> is allowed, and is required, while &lt;givenName>s are  optional and unbounded. The arrangement and content of the sub-elements is entirely  up to the EML document's author, who presumably has first-hand knowledge of  how the names are to be constructed. For example, if element position is important  (e.g., the list of a book's authors), then EML authors should put the creators in that order. If it is appropriate for a resource to have its creators sorted alphabetically, then the EML author should construct the name parts so that the&lt;surName> field may be used for this purpose. At this time, EML is not able to express cultural  conventions so that authors may indicate the correct order for  &lt;givenName>s and &lt;surName> when the whole name is expressed.  However support for international names is under consideration for a future version of  EML, along with other internationalization features. ">
