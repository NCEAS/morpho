It will most likely be part of a sequence of numbers or letters that are meaningful in a larger context, such as a metadata catalog. That larger system can be identified in the &quot;system&quot; attribute. Multiple identifiers can be listed corresponding to different catalog systems."

  <fieldDelimiter
  help="Variable width format fields (attributes) can vary in their field length, thus the end of the field is delimited by a special character called a field delimiter (typically a comma or a space). Data sets are generally classified as fixedWidth format or variableWidth format, but we have determined that this is actually a per-field classification because one may encounter fixedWidth fields mixed together in the same data file with variableWidth fields. In our encoding scheme, the start of each field is assumed to be the column after the last column of the previous field, or the first column if this is the first field in the dataset, unless the starting column is explicity enumerated using the &quot;fieldStartColumn&quot; element. The end column for each field is classified using either a special character delimeter indicated using the filedDelimiter element, or a fixed field length indicated by using the &quot;fieldWidth&quot; element. The delimiter for the last field in the data set can be omitted. variableWidth fields can vary in their field length, and the end of the field is delimited by a special character called a field delimiter, usually a comma or a tab character. fixedWidth fields have a set length, and so the end of the field can always be determined by adding the fieldWidth to the starting column number. Here is an example: Assume we have the following data in a data set: May,100aaaa,1.2, April,200aaaa,3.4, June,300bbbb,4.6, The metadata indicating the physical layout of the 4 fields would include the following:">
