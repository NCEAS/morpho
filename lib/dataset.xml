<descgeog help="A geographic extent description is especially important when the 
               extent of the data set is not well described by the

               are not specifically geospatial, to provide a geographic setting 
               for the item being documented. Assuming the 
               &quot;Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates&quot; do not adequately describe the 
               extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and 
               described in this data element. If the item being documented is 
               not specifically geospatial, the &quot;Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates&quot;

               the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For
               example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a 
               specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon 
               involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon 
               states, thus the &quot;Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates&quot; might form a 
               general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but
               the &quot;Description_of_Geographic_Extent&quot; might describe the fact 
               that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only 
               certain rivers within those states. This data element differs 
               from the standard data element &quot;Place_Keyword&quot; in that it allows 
               a free text description of the geographic extent, rather than
