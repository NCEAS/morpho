Absolute geologic  time is usually measured in millions of years before present,  but may use different units and relative base times. Relative  geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth s geology in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or  stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in  geologic studies often tie relative times measured through  stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time  using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these  methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the  dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be  inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative dates were measured.
