      Welcome to the Morpho Package Wizard.  This wizard will assist you in 
      creating a data package consisting of your data file(s) and the information
      about your data file needed to track and use it more efficiently.  You will
      be asked to fill out a series of forms with information pertinent to your
      data as well as to show the wizard which data file you wish to describe.
      When the wizard is finished, your new data package will be opened in the
      Morpho Package Editor so that you can further manipulate it.  You will
      also be given the chance to upload you package to your Metacat server 
      (if you have one).

      Scroll down to see more fields.  If a label is red, that field
      is required.  If a label is a button it is repeatable.  Click the button
      to repeat the element.  Whole groups can be repeated by clicking on the
      'repeat' button at the top of the group.

    <description name="Finish">
      The Package Wizard is now ready to create your new package.  The list 
      shows the files that the package will contain.  If you want to revise 
      your metadata, click the previous button to go back.

    <description name="Table">
      Data entered here should describe the tables in your dataset.
      If you have more than one table, you will be prompted
      to fill in another table form when you click the 'Next'
      button. You should fill out as many table forms as you
      have tables in your dataset.
    </description>
    <description name="Fields">
      Enter information about the fields in your previously described table here.
      Only the name and definition of the field are required.
