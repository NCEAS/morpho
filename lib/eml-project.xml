Assuming the  'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' do not adequately describe the  extent of the data set, the discrepancy can be identified and  described in this data element. If the item being documented is  not specifically geospatial, the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' can define a general polygon, such as a rectangle around a  country, with this 'Description_of_Geographic_Extent' element  containing a disclaimer concerning the  'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' and/or further detail concerning the geographic area of concern for the item being documented. For example, a study of the diseases of salmon may not have a  specific geographic extent associated with it, but the salmon  involved in the study were collected in Washington and Oregon  states, thus the 'Bounding_Rectangle_Coordinates' might form a  general rectangle around the states of Washington and Oregon, but the 'Description_of_Geographic_Extent' might describe the fact  that the extent within Washington and Oregon included only  certain rivers within those states.

Absolute geologic  time is usually measured in millions of years before present,  but may use different units and relative base times. Relative  geologic time is measured by subdivisions of the earth s geology in an order based upon relative age, most commonly, vertical or  stratigraphic position. The actual dating systems used in  geologic studies often tie relative times measured through  stratigraphy or biostratigraphy to a particular absolute time  using radioisotope dating techniques, among others. As these  methods for absolute dating have improved, the estimates of the  dates for strata have changed, consequently, it would be  inaccurate to record absolute dates in situations where relative dates were measured.
