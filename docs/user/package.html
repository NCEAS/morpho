    <p>Packages are the logical unit that Morpho uses to represent your data
    files and their descriptions (metadata).  Morpho provides an easy 
    interface for you to access your data and its descriptions.  There are two
    major components of Morpho that deal with packages; the Package Wizard which
    guides you in creating a new package and the Package Editor, which helps you
    manipulate existing packages.  Each of these interfaces are described in 
    detail below.  The links in the text will take you to a visual representation
    of the step being described.</p>

  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2" width="50%">
    <b>Adding basic information</b>
    <p>When you begin to
    create a package, you will use the Package Wizard to get started entering
    basic descriptions.  To <a href="packagesteps.html#newpackage">begin creating</a>
    your new package, select the 'File' menu and select 'New Data Package'.  The 
    <a href="packagesteps.html#pwopen">initial screen</a>
    of the Package Wizard should then be displayed.</p>
    <p>After reading the initial instructions of the Package Wizard, click
    the 'Next' button.  You will then be presented with the 
    <a href="packagesteps.html#pwscreen1">
    basic information
    screen</a>.  In this screen enter all of the contact information for each 
    person who had a part in collecting the data that you are describing.
    Also enter the title of the dataset and any keywords that apply to this
    dataset.</p>
    <p>Some fields in the package wizard are repeatable, that is, you may add a 
    copy of the same field if you need to describe more than one of the same type
    of information.  Sometimes, a group of fields can also be repeated as a unit.
    If a single field is repeatable, its label will be displayed as a button.  If
    you click the button, the field will repeat.  If a group of fields is repeatable,
    a 'Repeat' button will be displayed at the top of the group.  Clicking the 
    'Repeat' button will duplicate the entire group of fields.</p>
    <p>The Package Wizard alerts you to fields that are required by coloring
    their label <font color=red>red</font>.  If you do not fill in a field
    whose label is colored red, you will receive a warning message.  If you still
    do not fill in this field, you may have problems uploading your metadata
    to the Metacat server (if you have one).</p>
    <p>When you are done entering your basic information, click the 'Next' button.</p>
    <b>Adding a data file</b>
    <p>The next screen of the Package Wizard asks you to locate your 
    <a href="packagesteps.html#pwscreen2">data file</a>.
    You can do this by either clicking the 'Browse' button and navigating to your
    data file, or you can type the full path into the text box.  If you do not want
    to include your data file in a package and just wish to create data descriptions
    (metadata) leave the text box blank and click next.</p>
    <b>Adding table information</b>
    <p>The next screen displayed in the wizard is the 
    <a href="packagesteps.html#pwscreen3">table description form</a>.  Enter
    the description of your data table here.  If you have more than one table
    in your data file, enter information for only one of them here.  You can add
    additional tables later using the <a href="package.html#packageeditor">Package Editor</a>.</p>
    <b>Describing variables in your table</b>
    <p>The next screen displayed in the wizard is the 
    <a href="packagesteps.html#pwscreen4">field description form</a>.  Describe
    each of the fields in the previously described table.  To add more than one
    variable, use the 'Repeat' button at the top of the 'Field Information' group.</p>
    <b>Finishing up</b>
    <p>The <a href="packagesteps.html#pwscreen5">final screen</a> of the 
    Package Wizard gives you a summary of what you are
    creating and asks you some questions about putting your package onto your
    Metacat server.  The box at the top
    of the screen lists the items that are going to be in your package.  
    Selecting the 'Save package
    to Metacat' checkbox will upload the package to your Metacat server (if you
    have one).  If you uncheck the checkbox labeled 'Package should be publicly
    readable (on Metacat)' your package will not be accessible to anyone but 
    yourself.  Note that publicly accessible packages are read-only to anyone
    but yourself.  When you are satisfied with your new package, click 
    'Finish' and the new package will be created.</p>
    <p>Upon successful completion of the wizard process, the Package Editor
    will be opened with your new package being displayed.  Go on to the next
    section for a complete description of the Package Editor</p>

    <b>Package Editor</b>
    <p>The <a href="editorsteps.html#packageeditor">Package Editor</a> allows you to 
    manipulate an existing data package.  The editor is divided into two parts.
    The top of the window gives a summary of the basic information provided
    with each package.  To edit this basic information, click the 'Edit' button
    in the upper right part of the window.</p>
    <p>The bottom part of the screen describes the components that exist in 
    the package.  The 'Table Descriptions' box shows all of the tables for which
    there is a description.  Double clicking on a table description will bring
    up the <a href="editorsteps.html#tableeditor">Table Editor</a>
    for editing the table and field information.</p>
    <p>The 'Other Information' box shows a list of all of the descriptions
    that are do not describe table information.  This includes access control, 
    distribution, software and physical file descriptions.  Double clicking
    on any of these descriptions will allow you to edit it.</p>
    <p>The 'Remove' button at the bottom will remove any description from
    the package.  The 'Edit' button performs the same action as double clicking
    on a description (i.e. it opens an editor for the description).  The 'Add'
    button opens the 'Add New Description' wizard which guides you through
    adding new descriptions or data files to your package.</p>
    <b>Add New Description Wizard</b>
    <p>The <a href="editorsteps.html#newdesc">New Description Wizard</a>
    allows other you to add information to your
    package to more accurately describe your dataset.  The wizard also allows
    you to add a data file to your package.  You may add as many data files to 
    your package as you wish.</p>
    <p>The first question that the wizard asks is what type of information
    you would like to add.  Select whether you would like to add a new
    data file or a new description file.</p>
    <p>If you choose to add a new data file, you will be given an area to 
    type the path to your data file.  You may also browse to the data file.  If 
    you choose to add a new description file you will be presented with a 
    <a href="editorsteps.html#desclist">list</a>
    of types of descriptions that you can add.  Once you select the type of
    description you wish to add, click the 'Next' button.  You will then be
    presented with the <a href="editorsteps.html#editor">form</a> 
    to create the new description.  Once you are done
    entering your description, click the 'Save Changes' button on the data
    entry form.  You will then be shown the 
    <a href="editorsteps.html#finish">'Finish' screen</a> of the wizard where
    you can complete the process of adding your new description.  Click the 
    'Finish' button to add the new description and refresh your Package Editor.
