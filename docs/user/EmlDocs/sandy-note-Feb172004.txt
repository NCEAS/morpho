> Mark,



As we discussed, attached are the most recent drafts of the EML/Metadata guide that Eric (mainly) and I were working on.  It is now in your hands.

It is fine if you need to consult with Eric for up to 2 hours per week for the next few weeks as you complete this.

As we discussed, the target audience for this document was participants in the distributed graduate seminar (faculty and graduate students, representing fairly typical ecologists users).  We never intended it to be a technical document for data managers.  I think the needs of the two groups are very different.
