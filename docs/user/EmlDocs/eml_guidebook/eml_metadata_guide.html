      <p><h4>Introduction</h4></p>
      <p>
        The long-term value of ecological data, and its utility for advancing ecological
        understanding and solving important environmental problems depend on the availability
        of suitable and adequate metadata, or descriptive information describing data
        content, context, quality, structure and accessibility (Michener 2000). As
        a discipline, ecology is moving beyond its tradition of small-scale empirical
        observations and experiments conducted by one or a few investigators at relatively
        small scales (Kareiva &amp; Anderson 1988; Brown &amp; Roughgarden 1990).
        Increasingly, ecological and environmental research aims to understand complex
        ecological systems at broad spatial and temporal scales and requires access
        to data beyond what is typically contained within a single data collection
        effort. This changing focus has led to recognition within the community of
        the need for increased data sharing and long-term community access to data
        (e.g., Olson &amp; McCord 2000; Andelman et al. 2004) and presents new challenges
        for integration of heterogeneous ecological information across a range of
        spatial, temporal and organizational scales.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, investigations of many ecological phenomena, and the development
        of theory to explain them, have been limited by the availability of suitable
        long-term data. For example, the fragmentary nature of population dynamics
        research activities, which often has focused on analysis of individual data
        sets, has made it difficult to formulate general theory and to investigate
        large-scale spatial and taxonomic patterns. In response to this limitation,
        and motivated by the need to provide comprehensive access to biological population
        data, to facilitate discovery of general patterns and principles, to advance
        understanding of large-scale spatial and temporal patterns, and to enable
        researchers to acquire large numbers of datasets, without having to undertake
        repetitive, time-consuming and expensive searches, the Center for Population
        Biology at Imperial College, Silwood Park, the National Center for Ecological
        Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), and the University of Tennessee collaborated
        to develop the Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD; http://cpbnts1.bio.ic.ac.uk/gpdd/).
        The GPDD is now the largest collection of animal and plant population data
        in the world, and brings together nearly five thousand time series in one
        database. It provides an important resource for ecologists, resource managers
        and environmental scientists interested in the dynamics of natural populations
        or in asking comparative questions about the nature of population variability
        (e.g., Kendall et al. 1998; Kendall et al. 2000; Fagan et al. 2001; Inchausti
        &amp; Halley 2001; Inchausti &amp; Halley 2002; Inchausti &amp; Halley 2003).
      </p>
      <p>
        Synthetic efforts such as development of the GPDD are limited by the heterogeneity
        of ecological data and metadata. Ecological data exhibit a range of formats,
        reflecting different underlying motivations for data collection, different
        suites of variables and different spatial and temporal sampling designs. In
        addition, ecological metadata typically also are highly variable in extent,
        depth, quality and associated types of uncertainty (Andelman et al. 2004;
        Regan et al. 2002), and may consist of mental notes, hand-written notes in
        a field notebook, a comments field in an Excel spreadsheet or other forms
        of documentation. Currently, there is no single standard to guide the decision
        about what quantity and quality of metadata are sufficient to enable data
        that initially were collected for a single, relatively narrow purpose, to
        be understood and used appropriately for a variety of purposes. Unfortunately,
        this often means that the value of ecological data diminish over time, because
        important details about the data may be forgotten or lost by the original
        investigator, because of career changes, or changes in data storage and management
        technology (Michener 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
        This paper describes Ecological Metadata Language (EML; http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/eml/),
        a method for formalizing and standardizing the set of concepts that are essential
        for describing ecological data, and explains why and how creating metadata
        with EML will extend the long-term utility of ecological data and facilitate
        the processes of data discovery and integration.
      </p>
      <p><h4>Metadata</h4></p>
      <p>
        Metadata is the information that describes &#8220;who, what where, when,
        why and how&#8221; an ecological dataset was collected. Metadata literally
        means (meta ~ about) &#8220;about data&#8221;. Most of us have experienced
        the difficulty in using our own data after only a few months have passed since
        it was collected. Unless data are adequately documented, this difficulty only
        increases over time. Even the simplest analysis requires some level of metadata.
        For example, consider a simple data table, with no column headers (Table 1).
        Without metadata, a data table such as this one is useless. Unless we know
        the measurement units, the numbers in the columns are meaningless. Further,
        in this example, there is no metadata that would identify the location where
        data were collected, the focal organism or system, or the identity and location
        of the data owner. Table 2 shows the same data table, with some additional
        metadata. In this example we can see that data were collected in May, 2002,
        at a site, identified as VO. However, one can only guess at what VO might
        signify, or at the meaning of the columns with headers &#8220;S,&#8221; &#8220;R,&#8221;
        &#8220;Bm,&#8221; &#8220;P,&#8221; and &#8220;N.&#8221; signify. The lack
        of adequate metadata makes this dataset useless to anyone other than the original
        owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Table 3 illustrates a dataset with more comprehensive documentation. The
        data owner is identified, column headers are defined, and some general information
        is provided regarding how and where the data were collected. Depending on
        the intended use, access to this information may make this a useable dataset.
        However, the original owner of this data probably has additional information
        that would facilitate a more comprehensive description of the data and potentially
        make it more suitable for a broader range of research activities in the future.
        For example, inclusion of geographic coordinates or other information that
        describes the spatial location where the data were collected, or information
        about codes or numbers used to indicate missing data would increase the potential
        utility of these data.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example illustrates another common feature of metadata; the information
        provided is what the data owner decided to document. Without standards or
        guidelines for metadata content, if the same individual were to document another
        dataset, the same or different information might be included, and the format
        might or might not be the same. In this way, if analyses require multiple
        datasets from different owners, locations or times, it is
        unlikely that all relevant datasets would have metadata with equivalent levels
        of detail, use consistent terminology, or use consistent formats for metadata.
        The potentially infinite formats and types of information in which to document
        data suggest the need for metadata to be standardized. Table 4 provides an
        example of a much more detailed metadata document that was made using EML,
        in which each metadata concept (from dataset title to geographic description)
        has been formalized and standardized.
      </p>

        <h3>Creating Metadata with EML</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>NOTE: This for non-RDBMS datasets. Contact
        jones@ecoinformatics.ucsb.edu for more information.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a method for formalizing and
        standardizing the set of concepts that are essential for describing
        ecological data, as well as the format for recording this information.
        EML evolved from an open source, community-based effort involving
        ecological researchers, information managers, and software developers,
        led by the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis
        (NCEAS) and the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER).  The
        need for EML or a similar method to promote preservation and long-term
        utility of the growing archives of ecological data has been recognized
        for some time (FLED Report 1995, Michener et al, 1997; Olson &amp;
        McCord 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
        EML is intended for use by any ecologist or manager of ecological
        information.   It describes a range of essential aspects of
        ecological data, such as data attribute (usually thought of as
        variables by ecologists) names and definitions; units of measurement;
        date, time and location of data collection; who collected the data
        sampling design; etc.  EML attempts to reduce ambiguity and
        uncertainty by formalizing these metadata concepts into a comprehensive
        yet standardized set of terms and definitions intended specifically for
        ecological data.  The metadata in Table 4 provide an example of dataset
        that has been reasonably well-documented using EML.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question of ?How much metadata is enough?? does not have a
        clear-cut answer.  As a general guideline, an ecologist should be
        able to get a thorough understanding of a moderately complicated
        dataset after reviewing the metadata for 20 minutes.   If in doubt,
        assume that ?more is better,? because omitting detail from metadata
        at the outset may lead to problems later on (e.g., hours of discussion
        or exploratory analyses), and in the worst case may render the data
        unusable.  In general the more metadata you create the longer the
        lifespan of your dataset.
      </p>
      <p>
        A walk through each of the formalized EML metadata concepts shown
        in Table 4 will clarify some of the more important metadata concepts
        provided in EML.  The information in Table 4 is arranged in six broad
        metadata categories, each of which contains more detailed metadata.
        These categories are somewhat arbitrary, but are intended to categorize
        EML metadata fields in a way that is intuitive to ecologists.  The
        categories include the General Dataset, Geographic, Temporal, Taxonomic,
        Methods and Data Table Metadata sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        The General Dataset Metadata category contains EML metadata concepts
        that describe the purpose of the data collection and the questions
        the data were originally intended to address being collected to
        address.  Some types of metadata, such as the title and abstract
        are self-explanatory, but others may not be.  The usage rights
        field provides a place for information about who can use the
        dataset, and what, if any, restrictions there are on usage.  Other
        general dataset metadata information includes contact information for
        people who had a significant role in collecting or managing the data.
        At least one primary contact is recommended.  This should be the person
        to whom further questions regarding the data and metadata should be
        addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, in this category, information about the data or data collection
        methods may be provided in published papers.  EML provides fields for
        entering bibliographic information such as citations to journal
        articles or books. EML supports a range of standard reference styles,
        and permits importation directly from EndNote and other bibliographic
        software.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the name suggests, the Geographic Metadata category is used for g
        eographic and spatial metadata.   The geographic description field
        contains information about where the research project took place,
        where samples were collected and any spatial or geographic references
        that may provide a context for the data.  Latitude and longitude may
        also be entered here to increase geographic accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Temporal Metadata category contains information about when the
        research project started and ended.   Information can be stored
        either as a range of dates (e.g. data was collected every month
        between June 2002 &amp; 2003) or specific time periods
        (e.g. May 2002 and June 2003).  In addition, information about
        potential gaps in data collection or in the collection of some
        variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the dataset has species information there are Taxonomic Metadata
        fields that describe them.   Information such as the taxonomic
        authority (i.e. the book or system that is used to identify a species)
        and the taxonomic class (i.e. Family, Genus, Species) can be described
        here.  To facilitate entry of taxonomic information, tables or text
        files containing lists of species names can be uploaded as a single
        file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Methods Metadata category contains information on the methods used
        for data collection.   General methodological information such as the
        experimental design and the machines or devices used to collect data
        can be described here.  The methods documentation should be
        sufficiently detailed to allow someone to recreate the research project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Data Table contains information regarding the data table itself.
        There is physical data information such as the file name, whether or
        not the letters in the data table are case sensitive, the number of
        records and the structure of the data table (i.e., attribute names in
        columns or rows).  This category also contains metadata regarding the
        columns of data themselves.  The label is a word or phrase that
        describes the column, because acronyms or ambiguous abbreviations
        often are used as column headers.  The ?definition? field contains
        more descriptive information, indicating what the numbers in individual
        columns or rows represent.   The unit and type fields contain the units
        and data type (e.g., integer, floating point, etc.) for each column.
        Missing represents a number or symbol used to indicate that no data
        was collected (e.g., 9999).  Precision pertains to the accuracy of the
        measurement.  For example, if the numbers in a column represent output
        from a machine, there is often some level of precision or measurement
        error associated with the data.  Similarly, an investigator may have
        estimates of the precision associated with a particular data collection
        method.  The attribute description column provides definitions of any
        codes used in that column (e.g. VO = Vally Oak) and the range of values
        in a column (e.g. biomass values range from 10.04g/ m2 to 88.82g/m2).
      </p>
      <p>
        The metadata contained in Table 4 represent a minimum level of detail
        that would be required by someone with little or no prior knowledge
        about the dataset (or yourself after not working with the data for a
        few years) to determine whether or not the data are appropriate for
        some intended use.  Additionally, once someone has decided to use the
        data for a particular purpose, the metadata should be sufficient to
        enable the next research steps (e.g., contact the data owner for
        the dataset, or if the data are public and accessible, begin
        preliminary analyses).
      </p>
      <p>
         <h3>Documenting Data With Ecological Metadata Language (EML)</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point you have a basic understanding of the advantages of using
        EML, and you have seen an example of a reasonably well-documented
        dataset.   Currently, there are two mechanisms for creating EML
        to document your data:  Morpho, and web registries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Morpho</h4>
      </p>
      <p>
        Morpho is a cross-computer platform data and metadata management
        software program.  It enables an ecologist to create, edit and manage
        metadata and data tables.  Morpho also provides capabilities to search
        and query ecological data, both locally and remotely, on publicly
        accessible ecological data archives (i.e. ecological archives
        accessible via the internet).  Morpho includes wizards that facilitate
        using a subset of EML (e.g. Table 4) to document the most common
        attributes of your data.  In addition there are tools that provide
        access to the entire contents of EML, which currently include over
        2000 metadata concepts or terms for describing ecological data.  For
        more information see http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/morpho.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h4>Web Registries</h4>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another option is to document your data using a subset of EML through
        a web registry at http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/index.jsp.  To use t
        his tool you first must register (i.e., provide basic information
        about yourself and how you may be contacted).  Then you can create
        EML compliant metadata without installing Morpho.  As when using
        Morpho, the user can create EML metadata and make it broadly available
        to the ecological community through the internet.  Making EML metadata
        available facilitates the discovery of your dataset by ecologists
        around the world.  Additionally, large organizations and large
        research projects may want to create customized EML web interfaces
        (contact jones@nceas.ucsb.edu for information about how to do this).
        Currently, the web registries provide a mechanism for creating and
        querying metadata, however they do not provide direct access to the
        data, which requires Morpho.
      </p>
      <p>
        <h3>The Future</h3>
      </p>
      <p>
        By systematically documenting your data in a standardized and
        structured format, you will contribute to advancing ecological
        knowledge.  As ecological data and metadata archives grow,
        the value of these resources to the ecological community will increase.
        EML provides a common structure that ecologists can use to document,
        share and interpret ecological data.  The formal structure of EML also
        will facilitate the development of software applications that process
        the metadata.  EML is implemented in XML (Extensible Markup Language),
        a growing standard for marking up documents on the Web.  This means
        that EML metadata eventually will enable the use of a wide range of
        software, from basic search and query tools that can be used remotely
        through the web, to remote integration of heterogeneous datasets, to
        analysis and visualization.  For more information about EML and tools
        for creating metadata and sharing data, go to

        This experiment was designed to collect productivity, diversity and
        soil data for Northern California grasslands. The results were
        published in a paper titled ?Soil Nutrients and the Relationship
        between Diversity and Productivity? (Doe and Smith 2003). Data were
        collected at two sites, the Coastal Hills Reserve and the Valley Oak
        Reserve, within the coastal mountains of Northern California. The
        area is primarily oak (Quercus spp.) savannah and grasslands on
        limestone soil. In spring of 2002, 10-1 m2  plots were randomly
        distributed throughout a 100 km2 area of each location. All plots
        were placed on grasslands. In each plot, presence and absence of
        all plant species was recorded. All plants were then clipped at
        root level, dried and weighed to obtain above-ground peak standing
        biomass. As most of the production is from annual plants, peak
        standing biomass can be used as an approximate measure of annual
        productivity. Approximately 0.5 g of soil was collected from the
        mid point of each plot. This soil was taken back to the laboratory
        and analyzed for total nitrogen and phosphorous content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five species were observed in all plots. Nonnative plants observed
        included: <i>Avena fatua</i> and <i>Bromus  hordeaceus</i>.
        Native plants included <i>Eschscholziacalifornica</i>,
        <i>Nassellapulchra</i> and <i>Calochortuslutens</i>.
      </p>

        Codes used in data tables are given below:
        <u>Site</u>: Site at which data were collected. CH=Coastal Hills Reserve,
        VO=Valley Oaks Reserve, <u>Date</u>: Date data were collected mm/dd/yy
        format, <u>Plot</u>: Randomly assigned number of plot, <u>Sp1-Sp5</u>:
        Presence absence of each of five species. For each species, a value of 1
        indicates presence and a value of 0 indicates absence.
