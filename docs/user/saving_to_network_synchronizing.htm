    <p>Data packages, while created locally, can be uploaded to a network server
      to become a shared network Data Package. Data Packages are uploaded by
      choosing the 'File' menu, then clicking 'Synchronize'.</p>
    <p>Similarly to uploading a data package, you can download a data package
      to your local PC from the network by right-clicking and selecting "Synchronize" or
      through the same option on the file menu. Notice you also have the option
      to delete data packages. You are only allowed to delete packages that you
      have created, or for which you have special permissions. See more on <i>permissions</i> </p>
