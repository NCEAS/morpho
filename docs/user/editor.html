        <td colspan="2"> <p>The "general purpose" description editor 
                is used to display and possibly edit all the details of the structured 
                metadata documents used by Morpho.</p>
            <p>Examples of editor windows are shown below. The first shows general 
                information about a Data Package, and the second shows details of 
                the abstract for the dataset.</p>
            <div align="center"><img src="./images/editor3_eco.gif" width="550" height="515" > <br>
                <img src="./images/editor2_eco.gif" width="550" height="509" > </div>
            <p>Each type of data description document (i.e each metadata type) has 
                some structure which is indicated by the hierarchical outline on the 
                left. Items in the outline are color coded to indicate which items 
                are required and which can be repeated. The legend for this color-coding 
                is found at the bottom-left of the screen. </p>
            <p>When an item is selected in this outline, a form based view of the 
                information contained in the selected item is shown on the right side 
                of the window. A 'right-click' on any item in the outline displays 
                a popup menu (as shown below) which allows the user to choose among 
                several options. These include duplicating an item, deleting an item, 
                or copy and pasting items. Note that all of these operations will 
                include not only the selected item, but also all of the item's 'children' 
                in the indicated hierarchy. </p>
            <p align="center"> <img src="./images/editor1_eco.gif" width="550" height="509" > </p>
            <p>Most of the fields on the right side of the editor screen are editable. 
                One can just click on the field of interest and enter text. The 'tab 
                key' will move the selection to the next editable field. Note that 
                non-required fields that are empty will not be saved when changes 
                are made, but will appear again as empty fields when the document 
                is opened again in the editor. </p><br>

            <p><u>Technical Notes</u>: <br>
                For those who are interested in technical details, the Morpho editor 
                is an XML editor. It works by first reading an XML file and building 
                an outline (tree) view of the XML document. XML files can have formalized 
                templates called 'DTD's, which describe how the document can be constructed. 
                If the XML document indicates that its structure should conform to 
                a DTD, then the DTD is scanned and a single instance of any optional 
                nodes not present in the original is added to the hierarchy. Finally, 
                if the editor has additional data about the document type, it will 
                add that data as custom displays or help information about the node, 
                as is shown in the above examples. The editor can thus be customized 
                to display the XML data in a variety of ways.</p>
