<td colspan="2" WIDTH="100%">The "general purpose" description editor
is used to display and possibly edit all the details of the structured metadata
documents used by Morpho. 

<p>Examples of editor windows are shown below. The first shows
general information about a Data Package, and the second shows
details of the abstract for the dataset.
<p><img SRC="./images/editor3_eco.gif" ><br><br>
<p><img SRC="./images/editor2_eco.gif" ><br><br>

<p>Each type of data description document (i.e each metadata type) has
some structure which is indicated by the hierarchical outline on the left.
Items in the outline are color coded to indicate which items are required
and which can be repeated. The legend for this color-coding is found at
the bottom-left of the screen. 
<p>When an item is selected in this outline, a
form based view of the information contained in the selected item
is shown on the right side of the window. A 'right-click' on any item in
the outline displays a popup menu (as shown below) which allows the user
to choose among several options. These include duplicating an item, deleting an item, or
copy and pasting items. Note that all of these operations will include not only
the selected item, but also all of the item's 'children' in the indicated
hierarchy.
<p><img SRC="./images/editor1_eco.gif" ><br><br>

<p>Most of the fields on the right side of the editor screen are editable.
One can just click on the field of interest and enter text. The 'tab key'
will move the selection to the next editable field. Note that non-required
fields that are empty will not be saved when changes are made, but will
appear again as empty fields when the document is opened again in the editor.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><u>Technical Notes</u>:
<br>For those who are interested in technical details, the Morpho editor
is an XML editor. It works by first reading an XML file and building an
outline (tree) view of the XML document. XML files can have formalized templates
called 'DTD's, which describe how the document can be constructed.  If the
XML document indicates that its structure should conform to a DTD, then
the DTD is scanned and a single instance of any optional nodes not present
in the original is added to the hierarchy. Finally, if the editor has additional
data about the document type, it will add that data as custom displays
or help information about the node, as is shown in the above examples.
The editor can thus be customized to display the XML data in a variety
of ways.</td>
