      <p>Download Morpho<a name="downloadmorpho"></a></p>
      </div>
      <p>The first thing you should do is install the Morpho software.
Go to "http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/morphoportal.jsp" and choose the
appropriate link. You will have the option of downloading Java along
with Morpho if you do not already have it. Follow the directions in the
installer.</p>
      <p>
N.B. We recommend that you download the full version of Morpho with
Java, since there are some minor incompatibilities with Morpho if you
do not have the correct version of Java 1.4.2 or higher. Morpho's
installation of Java will only be used by Morpho, and will not disrupt
any earlier versions of Java which you have already installed.
      </p>
      <p>Morpho 1.5 is a Java application that runs on Mac OSX and
Windows 2000, XP, and higher. It also runs on Linux, but as of this
version there are some minor display problems. We recommend installing
Morpho on a newer, more powerful system, ideally a fast G4 Mac or
Pentium 4 PC or higher, with 256MB of RAM or more. Morpho 1.5 is
compatible with Ecological Metadata Language 2.0.0. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="helpsub"> Register for the KNB Network<a name="register"></a></p>
      <p>After installing Morpho (but before using Morpho), register
yourself on the KNB web site. Go to
"http://ldap.ecoinformatics.org/cgi-bin/ldapweb.cgi" and fill out the
form pictured below. Write down your name and password somewhere
secure. Registering with the KNB Network will provide you with access
to some advanced metadata and data services from the KNB, and does not
install any networked spyware on your system,
nor does it require that you be on a network in order to use Morpho.</p>
      <div align="center"><br>
      <img height="620" width="510" src="images/knbregister.gif"><br>
      </div>
      <div class="helpsub"><br>
Open Morpho and Create a Morpho Profile<a name="openmorpho"></a></div>
      <p> Open Morpho by double-clicking on its icon, or the file
called "Morpho.bat".</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The first time you execute Morpho, you will be asked to create
a new profile. This profile allows you to use Morpho locally on your
personal computer and, once registered for the KNB network (see
preceding "<a href="#register">Register for the KNB</a>" section), will
allow you to create, access, edit and search for data sets on the KNB
network.<br>
      <br>
If you are upgrading Morpho from a previous version, you will still be
prompted to create a new profile. If you want to continue using your
old profile(s) (so that your locally-stored data continues to be
visible), simply enter a "new profile" with the same name as the old
one, and you will be prompted if you would like to use the existing
profile. For example, if your old profile is named "jdoe", then enter
"jdoe" as the name of the new profile, and when you finish the profile
wizard, Morpho will ask if you want to keep your existing profile --
click "Yes". This will only work if you logged into your computer with
the same account under which your old profile existed.<br>
      </p>
      <p> Enter your profile name, and your first and last names, under
"Basic Information" in the New Profile screen, pictured below. Your
profile name does not have to be the same as your Metacat (KNB) network
username.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <div align="center">
      <p><img height="434" width="568" src="images/newprofile1.gif"><br>
      </p>
      </div>
      <p>Click "Next" to move on to the "Metacat Account Information"
screen, pictured below. Here you should enter the Metacat username and
the organization name which you registered on the
"http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/index.jsp" site. If you are not on the
Internet, or you do not want to register with the KNB, you can enter
any username here and Morpho will still work. But if you do not
reference a valid KNB account here, and associate it
with this profile, you will only be able to store your metadata files
locally, and not be able to login to the KNB to take advantage of the
advanced storage, access, and querying capabilities provided by Metacat.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <div align="center">
      <p><img height="434" width="568" src="images/newprofile2.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </div>
      <p>Click "Next" to move to the "Miscellaneous Information"
screen, pictured below. The identifier prefix that you enter will
become the prefix of your stored metadata file names. For example,
jdoe.xml.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="434" width="568"
 src="images/newprofile3.gif"><br>
      </p>
      <p>Click "Finished" to move on to the "Metacat Login" screen,
pictured below, where you should enter your Metacat password.
Alternatively, you can login on the <a href="main_welcome_screen.html">main
welcome screen</a> of Morpho, described in the next section.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <div align="center"><img border="0" align="bottom" height="284"
 width="334" src="./images/metacat_login.gif"> <br>
      </div>
      <p><font color="yellow"> <font size="+2" color="#ff0000"><b>!</b></font></font>
By entering your password and clicking the "Login" button you will be
able to create, edit, search, access and manage data that is stored
both locally (on your computer) and on the KNB network. By selecting
"Skip Login" you will be able to do all the previous operations
locally, and may search for data sets on the KNB network. However, you
will not be allowed to create or edit data sets on the KNB network
unless you are logged in via a valid KNB account. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The next screen you will see after logging in is <a
 href="main_welcome_screen.html">The Main Welcome Screen.</a> Read
about it in the next section.</p>
