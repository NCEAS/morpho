      <p>The KNB is an international data repository dedicated to facilitating ecological and environmental 
        research on biocomplexity. It enables the efficient discovery, access, and interpretation of ecological data ranging from 
        individual researcher efforts to  highly distributed field stations, research sites, and laboratories.<br>
The three main components of the KNB are Morpho, Metacat and EML. Morpho is a framework for storing and serving data and metadata. Metacat is a metadata catalog server and EML is a formal specification for ecological metadata language.

 Source code
    for all the products developed under the KNB are available for downloading
    at <a href="http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/">http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software/</a>.</p>

      <p class="helpsub">Morpho</p>
      <p>Morpho is a data management tool for ecologists. It was created to provide
         an easy-to-use, cross-platform application for accessing and manipulating
        
        metadata (e.g. documentation) and data (both locally and on the network).
        Morpho allows ecologists to create metadata, (<i>i.e. describe their
        data in a standardized format</i>),
          and create a catalog of data &amp metadata upon which to query, edit and
           view data collections. In addition, Morpho provides the means to access
          
        network servers, in order to query, view and retrieve relevant, public
           ecological data!</p>
      <p>Morpho
          can be used to perform the following basic operations: 
      
      <ul>
        <li>Create and Edit Metadata 
        
        <li>Search and Query Metadata Collections 
        
        <li>View Data and Data Collections 
        
        <li>Verify and Edit Data 
        
        <li>Provide Access Control
        
      </ul>
      <p>Many types of &quot;data&quot; can be used with Morpho,
          including data tables and images.</p>

      <p class="helpsub">Metacat</p>
      <p>Metacat stands for &quot;Metadata Catalog&quot;. Metacat
          servers allow ecologists to share their data and metadata via the Internet.
          A Metacat
        is essentially a server from which ecologists (through using Morpho)
          can upload, download, store, query and view relevant metadata and data
          on the KNB (Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity). Metacat servers can
          also be accessed independently of Morpho, such as via a Web browser,
          or calls from a database, but this requires some specialized programming.
          Morpho is the easiest way for most ecologists to immediately access
          and store metadata and data on a Metacat server. Among other things,
        the KNB supports a network of Metacat servers. </p>

  <p class="helpsub">Ecological Metadata Language (EML)</p>
      <p>Ecological Metadata Language (EML) is a metadata specification developed
         by and for the ecology discipline. It is based
        on prior work done by the Ecological Society of America and associated
         efforts (Michener et al., 1997, Ecological Applications <strong>7</strong>: 330-342). EML is implemented
        as a series of XML schema and document types, that can be used in a modular and extensible
         manner to document ecological data. Each EML module is designed to describe
        one logical part of the total metadata that should be included with any
         ecological data set.</p>
