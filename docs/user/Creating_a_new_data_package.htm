  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2" width="50%"><p>&nbsp;</p>      <p>There are three equivalent ways you can begin to create your own, new
      data package. Begin by doing one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Click the
          new data package icon <img src="images/new_package_icon.gif" width="29" height="27"> in
          the <a href="main_welcome_screen.html#welcometoolbar">main toolbar</a>.</li>
      <li>Click on &quot;Create a New Data Package...&quot; on the <a href="main_welcome_screen.html">Main
        Welcome Screen</a>.</li>
      <li>Under &quot;File&quot;, choose &quot;New Data Package&quot;.</li>
    </ul>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then be presented with the Data Package Wizard, the main vehicle
      through which the general information and basic descriptions of the data
      package are entered into a data package description.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="helpsub"><a name="dpw"></a>Data Package Wizard</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The Data Package Wizard will help you create the minimum amount of documentation
      necessary for a Data Package. 
      The Package Wizard alerts you to fields that are required by coloring
      their label <font color=red>red</font>. However, the more documentation
      you provide, the easier it will be for scientists and the KNB network to
      understand
      and utilize your data package. If you do not fill in a field whose
      label is colored red, you will receive a reminder message and will not
      be allowed to continue. Remember, you can always change the required or
      any other information at a later time using the Morpho Editor. See the
      later section, <a href="Editing_a_data_package.htm">Editing
        a Data Package</a>,
      for detail on this.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Throughout the Data Package Wizard, instructions for filling out fields
      on each screen will be shown. It is recommended that you read the explanatory
      text of any Morpho screen. </p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Each of the Data Package Wizard screens are displayed and explained below.
      You go from one screen to the next, or back to a previous screen, using
      the &quot;Next&quot; and &quot;Back&quot; buttons. Hit &quot;Cancel&quot; to cancel the creation of the
      new data package.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>        <p>The first screen of the data package wizard lists the
      types of information you should gather (or have in mind) before beginning
      to create a new data
      package. This screen is pictured below.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen1.gif" width="761" height="460"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <div align="center"> </div>    
    <p>You enter the title and an abstract for the data package on the next screen.
      The data set title is required. The abstract is optional, but is one of
      the most useful portions of the data documentation for those who may view
      the
      documentation
      in the future, and therefore it is highly recommended that an abstract
      be included. You may type the abstract directly into the field, or paste
      it in after creating it elsewhere.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen2.gif" width="718" height="472"></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Clicking &quot;Next&quot; brings you to the Keywords screen. One or
      many keywords can be entered by clicking &quot;Add&quot;.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen3.gif" width="718" height="472"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Clicking &quot;Add&quot; brings you to the screen pictured below. Click &quot;Add&quot; to
      add a keyword. Click &quot;Add&quot; again to add another keyword. You
      may delete a keyword you have entered by clicking&quot;Delete&quot;.
      You also can alter the order of the keywords by using the &quot;Move Up&quot; and &quot;Move
      Down&quot; buttons
      while
      the keyword you wish to move is selected.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If the keywords are taken from a predefined list, such as a thesaurus,
      then click on the circle next to &quot;These keywords are chosen from a
      predefined list&quot;, and type the name of the source in the box that
      appears. Otherwise, click &quot;OK&quot; when you are done adding keywords.
      You will then be shown the list of keywords you have created in the screen
      that is pictured above.
      To add another, entirely separate list of keywords, click &quot;Add&quot; and
      repeat the
      steps described
      above
      to
      create
      another
      keyword
      list. You can also use the &quot;Edit&quot;, &quot;Delete&quot;, &quot;Move
      Up&quot;, and &quot;Move Down&quot;
      buttons to edit, delete or change the order of the keyword lists. When
      you are
      finished adding keywords and keyword lists, click &quot;Next&quot; at the
      bottom of the screen.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen4.gif" width="717" height="473"></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then see the screen pictured below which lists the information
      that can be entered in the next few screens. Read the screen, and click
      &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen5.gif" width="718" height="472"></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The &quot;Owner Details&quot; screen, pictured below, is where you can
      enter name, address, contact, and other information about the owner of
      the data set.
      Alternatively, you can choose an entry that you have already made previously
      by choosing it from the drop-down list at the top of the screen. One of
      the three fields shown in red must have information entered into it to
      proceed. Click &quot;OK&quot; when done.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen6.gif" width="718" height="499"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then be presented with a screen which will display the information
      you have entered. You may add additional owners, delete owners that are
      listed, edit entries, or change the order of the owners using the buttons
      on the right of the screen. Click &quot;Next&quot; when you are finished
      entering the
      owner
      or
      owners' information.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Next, a screen similar to the one used for entering information about
      the data set owner will appear, except that this screen is used to enter
      information about the contact for the data set. This person or organization
      may be the same as the owner, in which case you can choose the appropriate
      owner from the drop-down list at the top of the screen. Otherwise, enter
      the information for the contact into the fields, and click &quot;OK&quot;.
      Just as before, you will then be shown
      the contact person
      you entered, and have the ability to add additional contacts, delete contacts
      listed, edit entries, or change the order in which the contacts appear
      in the list. Click&quot;Next&quot; when you are finished entering the
      contact(s) for
      the
      data
      set.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The next screen, pictured below, allows you to enter information for associated
      parties (people, organizations, etc.) associated with the data set. Clicking &quot;Add&quot;
      will
      bring you to a
      screen where the information about the associated party can be entered.
      It is similar to that used to enter information about the data set owner
      and contact. Similarly, after clicking &quot;OK&quot;, you may add additional
      associated parties, edit entries, delete entries, and change the order
      of entries in
      the list. Click &quot;Next&quot; at the bottom of the screen when you are
      finished adding associated party information.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen7.gif" width="717" height="473"></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then be presented with the following screen. Click the box if
      the project associated with the data set is part of a larger project. Leave
      the box unchecked otherwise. If it is associated with a larger project
      and you click in the box, you will be prompted to enter the name of the
      larger
      project,
      its
      funding
      source,
      and one or
      more
      personnel
      associated
      with the larger project. Click &quot;Next&quot;.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen8.gif" width="717" height="473"></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The next screen allows you to enter a description of the usage rights
      of the data package. You may type directly in the field, or paste in a
      paragraph of text created elsewhere. Click &quot;Next&quot; when finished
      with this screen.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen%209.gif" width="716" height="472"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the next step of the Data Package Wizard (pictured below), you have
      the ability to enter information about the geographic coverage of the data.
      Click
      &quot;Add&quot; to add a geographic coverage documentation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen10.gif" width="716" height="472"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then be presented with the screen pictured below. You may type
      a textual description of the spatial coverage of the data in the first
      field (or paste a description in from elsewhere). In addition, you can
      specify the geographic coordinates of the coverage. There are three options
      for choosing the geographic coordinates. For any of these options, click
      &quot;Zoom In&quot; or &quot;Zoom Out&quot; to change the view of the map.
      Do one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create a bounding box by selecting &quot;Box Tool&quot; and dragging the mouse
        on the map. You can then adjust the edges of the box by selecting and
        dragging
          the white squares located on the edges of the bounding box.</li>
      <li>Select a point on the map be selecting &quot;Point Tool&quot; and clicking
        on the map.</li>
      <li>Select a predefined region or point by selecting one of the choices
        in the list of Named Regions at the bottom of the screen. To add a named
        region
          so that in the future it will appear in this list, select the region
        or point on the mao, and click &quot;Add&quot;. To remove a named region from the
        list,
          select the region and click &quot;Delete&quot;.</li>
    </ul>        
    <p>After doing any of these options, the coordinates for the bounding
      box or for the point will be displayed on the right of the screen. Click
      &quot;OK&quot; when finished adding the documentation or selecting the coordinates
      for the geographic coverage. You will then be returned to the screen pictured
      above, and your documentation will be listed.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You may add additional geographic coverage documentation by clicking &quot;Add&quot; again
      on the screen pictured above. As before, you can edit, delete, or change
      the
        order of the geographic descriptions you have entered.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen11.gif" width="730" height="522"></p>    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will next be prompted to describe the temporal coverage of the data
      set. Click&quot;Add&quot; to add a temporal coverage description.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen12.gif" width="716" height="472"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then see the screen below. There are two options for selecting
        a temporal coverage for your data. Do one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select &quot;Single Point in Time&quot; for a temporal coverage of a single year,
          month, or day. </li>
      <li>Select &quot;Range of Date/Time&quot; to specify a starting and ending of the
        temporal coverage of the data.</li>
    </ul>    
    <p>After choosing either of these options, select whether you want to specify
      the year only, the month and the year, or the day, month and year. Next,
        choose the
        appropriate
        temporal
          coverage in the calendar displayed. You may use the arrows to select
        the month and year, or you can type the month or year into the appropriate
        fields. To select a day, click on that day in the calendar pictured.
      When selecting a date/time range, make sure to select the start date/time
      on
        the left calendar, and the ending date/time on the right calendar. If
      the data is still being collected or added to, and therefore there is no
      end
      date/ time for the data set, then leave the right hand calendar blank.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Click &quot;OK&quot; at the bottom of the screen when finished. You will
      be shown your temporal coverage entry on the screen pictured above. You
      may add another temporal coverage for the data set, or edit, delete, and
      change the order of existing entries in the list. Click&quot;Next&quot; when
      finished adding temporal coverage information.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen%2013.gif" width="716" height="548"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then see the screen pictured below which is where taxonomic coverage
      documentation can be entered.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/taxonomic2.gif" width="714" height="468"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are two ways to add taxonomic information to the documentation.
      One is to type in the fields shown in the screen above to add taxonomic
      coverage for one or two taxon ranks (such as genus and species). To add
      additional levels of taxonomic information, click on the &quot;Edit&quot; button.
      You will then see the screen pictured below, where you can specify the
      name and common names for various taxonomic ranks. When finished, click
      the &quot;Add&quot; button. You may also delete an entry, or change the
      order of entries using the buttons located at the right of the screen.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/taxonomic3.gif" width="710" height="461"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The second way to add taxonomic information is to click on &quot;Import
      Taxon Information from a Data Table&quot;. This data table must be one
      that you have already added to the data package in Morpho (see <a href="Adding_Data_to_a_Data_Package.htm">Adding
      Data to a Data Package</a> for information on how this is done). If you
      click on the import taxon information link, you will see the screen pictured
      below.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/taxonomic4.gif" width="600" height="450"></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These column are from a data table in a fictitious sample data package
      that comes with Morpho. This feature can be used to select taxonomic names
      from a data table which contains a column of taxonomic information, which
      will speed the input if taxonomic information into the documentation. Begin
      by choosing which columns of taxonomic information you wish to import
      by checking the box of that column. Notice that a pop up box will prompt
      you to choose the taxon rank that the values in the column correspond to.
      Next, decide whether all of the values in the selected column(s) will be
      imported, or if only certain values which actually appear in the data are
      to be imported. Finally, click &quot;Import&quot;.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then be returned to the previous screen, where the taxonomic
      information will be displayed. You can then add additional taxonomic information,
      or edit or delete selected information. You may also specify what taxonomic
      classification system is used for the taxonomic information by clicking
      the box at the bottom left of the screen and typing in the name of that
      system. Click &quot;OK&quot; when finished, and then &quot;Next&quot;.</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You will then be prompted to describe the methods, study extent, and sampling
        description, on the screen shown below. Each of these can be typed directly
        into the fields or pasted in from elsewhere. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Methods can be described in a single or multiple steps. To add a description
      of the method as a whole, or the first step in the method, click &quot;Add&quot;.
      You will then be prompted to enter a method title (optional) and a method
      description. Click &quot;OK&quot; when finished entering the method title
      and /or description. The method will be displayed in the list on the screen
      pictured
      below. Click &quot;Add&quot; again to add another method or method step.
      You can also edit, delete, and change the order of methods or method steps
      you
      have entered using the buttons on the right of the screen.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Enter information into study extent to supplement the information you
      already provided on the temporal or spatial extent of the study. For example,
      missing years for temporal coverage should be noted here, or a description
      of temporal coverage for data sets beyond the calendar range provided previously
      (such as &quot;the pleistocene&quot;). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Finally, in the sampling description field you can provide detail on the
      sampling design of the study. Click &quot;Next&quot; after describing methods,
      study extent, and sampling description as you would like.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen14.gif" width="716" height="488"></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The next screen allows you to control the access to your data and the
      data set. First, indicate whether or not you would like the public to
      be able to read your data package documentation once it is placed on a
      network (which is described in the section <a href="saving_to_network_synchronizing.htm">Uploading
      and Downloading Data Packages</a>).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You may then specify specific people and detail the permission you wish
      to grant them for the data package. Click&quot;Add&quot; if you wish to
      specify access rights for these people.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen15.gif" width="716" height="488"></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>    
    <p>Defining the people and their access rights
      is accomplished on the screen pictured below. Begin by browsing through
      the list of groups and users on
      the left of the screen. You can expand the list by clicking on the plus
      sign next to the group, or shrink the list back to its original form by
      clicking refresh at the bottom of the screen. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>After selecting a specific
        user, you will be prompted to type in their name,
        organization,and
        email
        address.
        Next,
        define
        their
        access permissions on the right of the screen. Choose Allow or Deny,
      and then Read, Read and Write, Read and Write and Change Permissions, or
      All
        from the drop down menus. If you are unsure about what each of these
      means, read the description of each at the bottom of the screen. Click
      &quot;OK&quot; when you are finished defining access for one user.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You may define access for additional users by clicking&quot;Add&quot; again
      on the screen pictured above. As before, you can also edit, delete, or
      change
      the ordering of entries you have made by using the buttons on the right
      of the screen pictured above. Click &quot;Next&quot; when finished.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>    <p align="center"><img src="images/dpwscreen%2016.gif" width="713" height="438"></p>
    <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="left">The final screen of the Data Package Wizard is pictured
      below. Congratulations - you have created a rudimentary data package documentation!
      Click &quot;Finish&quot; to view the documentation. Alternatively, you may
      add an actual data object, such as a table or an image, at this step in
