          documentation necessary for a Data Package. This process consists of
          15 simple steps, each involving a separate screen. The Package Wizard
          alerts you to fields that are required by coloring their label <font color="red">red</font>.
          However, the more documentation (i.e., metadata) you provide, the easier
          it will be for scientists (including you!) and the KNB network to understand
          and utilize your data package. If you do not fill in a field whose
          label is colored red, you will receive a reminder message and will
          not be allowed to continue. Remember, you can always change the required
          or any other information at a later time using the Morpho Editor. See
          the later section, <a
 href="Editing_a_data_package.htm">Editing a Data Package</a>, for details on
