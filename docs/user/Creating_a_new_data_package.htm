      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>This chapter will describe the important task of creating a
new data package, which is necessary if you want to document (create
metadata for) your own data.</p>
      <p>
There are three equivalent ways you can begin to create your
own, new data package. Begin by doing one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Click the new data package icon <img height="27" width="29"
 src="images/new_package_icon.gif"> in the
          <a href="main_welcome_screen.html#welcometoolbar">main
toolbar</a>.</li>
        <li>Click on "Create a New Data Package..." on the <a
 href="main_welcome_screen.html">Main Welcome Screen</a>.</li>
        <li>Under "File", choose "New Data Package".</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You will then be presented with the Data Package Wizard, a
handy and powerful utility which enables you to collect the general
information and basic
descriptions about your data. Morpho uses the resulting documentation
to generate your data package. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="helpsub"><a id="dpw" name="dpw"></a>Data Package
Wizard</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The Data Package Wizard will help you create the minimum
amount
of documentation necessary for a Data Package. This process consists of
15 simple steps,
each involving a separate screen. The Package Wizard
alerts you to fields that are required by coloring their label
      <font color="red">red</font>. However, the more documentation
(i.e., metadata) you
provide, the easier it will be for scientists (including you!) and the
KNB network
to understand and utilize your data package. If you do not fill in
a field whose label is colored red, you will receive a reminder
message and will not be allowed to continue. Remember, you can
always change the required or any other information at a later time
using the Morpho Editor. See the later section, <a
 href="Editing_a_data_package.htm">Editing a Data Package</a>, for
details
on this.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Throughout the Data Package Wizard, instructions for filling
out
fields on each screen will be shown. It is recommended that you
read the explanatory text of any Morpho screen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Each of the Data Package Wizard screens are displayed and
explained below. You go from one screen to the next, or back to a
previous screen, using the "Next" and "Back" buttons. Hit "Cancel"
to cancel the creation of the new data package.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The first screen of the data package wizard lists the types of
information you should gather (or have in mind) before beginning to
create a new data package. This screen is pictured below.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="573" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen1.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <div align="center"></div>
      <p>You enter the title and an abstract for the data package on
the
next screen. The data set title is required. The abstract is
optional, but is one of the most useful portions of the data
documentation for those who may view the documentation in the
future, and therefore it is highly recommended that an abstract be
included. You may type the abstract directly into the field, or
paste it in after creating it elsewhere.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="464" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen2.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Clicking "Next" brings you to the Keywords screen. One or many
keywords can be entered by clicking "Add".</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="464" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen3.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Clicking "Add" brings you to the screen pictured below. Click
"Add" to add a keyword. Click "Add" again to add another keyword.
You may delete a keyword you have entered by selecting it and clicking
"Delete". You can also alter the order of the keywords by using the
"Move Up" and
"Move Down" buttons while the keyword you wish to move is
selected.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If the keywords are taken from a predefined list, such as a
thesaurus, then click on the circle next to "These keywords are
chosen from a predefined list", and type the name of the source in
the box that appears. Otherwise, click "OK" when you are done
adding keywords. You will then be shown the list of keywords you
have created in the screen that is pictured above. To add another,
entirely separate list of keywords, click "Add" and repeat the
steps described above to create another keyword list. You can also
use the "Edit", "Delete", "Move Up", and "Move Down" buttons to
edit, delete or change the order of the keyword lists. When you are
finished adding keywords and keyword lists, click "Next" at the
bottom of the screen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="473" width="717"
 src="images/dpwscreen4.gif"></p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You will then see the screen pictured below which lists the
information that can be entered in the next few screens. Read the
screen, and click "Next".</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="464" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen5.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Click "Add" on the next screen (pictured below) to add
information about the data set owners.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="464" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen5b.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The "Owner Details" screen, pictured below, is where you can
enter name, address, contact, and other information about the owner of
the data set. Alternatively, you can choose an entry that you have
already made previously by choosing it from the drop-down list at the
top of the screen. This drop-down list includes an option to choose a
previous entry made in a different data package, where you will be
presented with a list of data packages and thier owners, and you can
select one from the list. One of the three fields shown in red must
have information entered into it to proceed. Click "OK" when done.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="499" width="718"
 src="images/dpwscreen6.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You will then be presented with a screen which will display
the
information you have entered. You may add additional owners, delete
owners that are listed, edit entries, or change the order of the
owners using the buttons on the right of the screen. Click "Next"
when you are finished entering the owner or owners'
information.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Next, a screen similar to the one used for entering
information
about the data set owner will appear, except that this screen is
used to enter information about the contact for the data set. This
person or organization may be the same as the owner, in which case
you can choose the appropriate owner from the drop-down list at the
top of the screen. Otherwise, enter the information for the contact
into the fields, and click "OK". Just as before, you will then be
shown the contact person you entered, and have the ability to add
additional contacts, delete contacts listed, edit entries, or
change the order in which the contacts appear in the list.
Click"Next" when you are finished entering the contact(s) for the
data set.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The next screen, pictured below, allows you to enter
information
for associated parties (people, organizations, etc.) associated
with the data set. Clicking "Add" will bring you to a screen where
the information about the associated party can be entered. It is
similar to that used to enter information about the data set owner
and contact. Similarly, after clicking "OK", you may add additional
associated parties, edit entries, delete entries, and change the
order of entries in the list. Click "Next" at the bottom of the
screen when you are finished adding associated party
information.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="464" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen7.gif"></p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="researchproject"></a>You will then be presented with
the following screen. Click the
box if the project associated with the data set is part of a larger
project. Leave the box unchecked otherwise. If it is associated
with a larger project and you click in the box, you will be
prompted to enter the name of the larger project, its funding
source, and one or more personnel associated with the larger
project. Click "Next".</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="464" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen8.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="usagerights"></a>The next screen allows you to enter
a description of the usage
rights of the data package. You may type directly in the field, or
paste in a paragraph of text created elsewhere. Click "Next" when
finished with this screen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="464" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen9.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="geogcov"></a>In the next step of the Data Package
Wizard (pictured below),
you have the ability to enter information about the geographic
coverage of the data. Click "Add" to add a geographic coverage
documentation.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="472" width="725"
 src="images/dpwscreen10.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You will then be presented with the screen pictured below. You
may type a textual description of the spatial coverage of the data
in the first field (or paste a description in from elsewhere). In
addition, you can specify the geographic coordinates of the
coverage. There are three options for choosing the geographic
coordinates. For any of these options, click "Zoom In" or "Zoom
Out" to change the view of the map. Do one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a bounding box by selecting "Box Tool" and dragging
the
mouse on the map. You can then adjust the edges of the box by
selecting and dragging the white squares located on the edges of
the bounding box.</li>
        <li>Select a point on the map be selecting "Point Tool" and
clicking on the map.</li>
        <li>Select a predefined region or point by selecting one of the
choices in the list of Named Regions at the bottom of the screen.
To add a named region so that in the future it will appear in this
list, select the region or point on the map, and click "Add". To
remove a named region from the list, select the region and click
"Delete". You can also "Sort" the items in the list.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After doing any of these options, the coordinates for the
bounding box or for the point will be displayed on the right of the
screen. Click "OK" when finished adding the documentation or selecting
the coordinates for the geographic coverage. You will then be returned
to the screen pictured above, and your documentation will be listed.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may add additional geographic coverage documentation by
clicking "Add" again on the screen pictured above. As before, you
can edit, delete, or change the order of the geographic
descriptions you have entered.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="576" width="782"
 src="images/dpwscreen11.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="tempcov"></a>You will next be prompted to describe
the temporal coverage of the data set. Click "Add" to add a temporal
coverage description.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="472" width="725"
 src="images/dpwscreen12.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You will then see the screen below. There are two options for
selecting a temporal coverage for your data. Do one of the
following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Select "Single Point in Time" for a temporal coverage of a
single year, month, or day.</li>
        <li>Select "Range of Date/Time" to specify a starting and
ending of
the temporal coverage of the data.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>After choosing either of these options, select whether you
want
to specify the year only, the month and the year, or the day, month
and year. Next, choose the appropriate temporal coverage in the
calendar displayed. You may use the arrows to select the month and
year, or you can type the month or year into the appropriate
fields. To select a day, click on that day in the calendar
pictured. When selecting a date/time range, make sure to select the
start date/time on the left calendar, and the ending date/time on
the right calendar. If the data is still being collected or added
to, and therefore there is no end date/ time for the data set, then
leave the right hand calendar blank.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Click "OK" at the bottom of the screen when finished. You will
be shown your temporal coverage entry on the screen pictured above.
You may add another temporal coverage for the data set, or edit,
delete, and change the order of existing entries in the list.
Click"Next" when finished adding temporal coverage information.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="548" width="716"
 src="images/dpwscreen13.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="taxcov"></a>You will then see the screen pictured
below which is where
taxonomic coverage documentation can be entered.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="464" width="735"
 src="images/taxonomic2.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>There are two ways to add taxonomic information to the
documentation. One is to type in the fields shown in the screen
above to add taxonomic coverage for one or two taxon ranks (such as
genus and species). To add additional levels of taxonomic
information, click on the "Edit" button. You will then see the
screen pictured below, where you can specify the name and common
names for various taxonomic ranks. When finished, click the "Add"
button. You may also delete an entry, or change the order of
entries using the buttons located at the right of the screen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="442" width="706"
 src="images/taxonomic3.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The second way to add taxonomic information is to click on
"Import Taxon Information from Data Table". This data table must
be one that you have already added to the data package in Morpho
(see <a href="Adding_Data_to_a_Data_Package.htm">Adding Data to a
Data Package</a> for information on how this is done). If you have not
yet added
a data table to the data package, ignore this option for now - you can
always
add data and documentation for the taxonomic coverage later (click <a
 href="Editing_a_data_package.htm#taxonomic">here</a> to
read
how). If
you
click
on the import taxon information link after adding data to the data
package, you
will
see
the
screen
pictured below.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="450" width="600"
 src="images/taxonomic4.gif"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>These columns are from a data table in a fictitious sample
data
package that comes with Morpho. This feature can be used to select
taxonomic names from a data table which contains a column of
taxonomic information, which will speed the input of taxonomic
information into the documentation. Begin by choosing which columns
of taxonomic information you wish to import by checking the box of
that column. Notice that a pop up box will prompt you to choose the
taxon rank that the values in the column correspond to. Next,
decide whether all of the values in the selected column(s) will be
imported, or if only certain values which actually appear in the
data are to be imported. Finally, click "Import".</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You will then be returned to the previous screen, where the
taxonomic information will be displayed. You can then add
additional taxonomic information, or edit or delete selected
information. You may also specify what taxonomic classification
system is used for the taxonomic information by clicking the box at
the bottom left of the screen and typing in the name of that
system. Click "OK" when finished, and then "Next".</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="meth"></a>You will then be prompted to describe the
methods, study extent,
and sampling description, on the screen shown below. Each of these
can be typed directly into the fields or pasted in from
elsewhere.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Methods can be described in a single or multiple steps. To add
a
description of the method as a whole, or the first step in the
method, click "Add". You will then be prompted to enter a method
title (optional) and a method description. Click "OK" when finished
entering the method title and /or description. The method will be
displayed in the list on the screen pictured below. Click "Add"
again to add another method or method step. You can also edit,
delete, and change the order of methods or method steps you have
entered using the buttons on the right of the screen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Enter information into study extent to supplement the
information you already provided on the temporal or spatial extent
of the study. For example, missing years for temporal coverage
should be noted here, or a description of temporal coverage for
data sets beyond the calendar range provided previously (such as
"the pleistocene").</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Finally, in the sampling description field you can provide
detail on the sampling design of the study. Click "Next" after
describing methods, study extent, and sampling description as you
would like.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="488" width="728"
 src="images/dpwscreen14.gif"></p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="accesspermissions"></a>The next screen allows you to
control the access to your data
and the data set. First, indicate whether or not you would like the
public to be able to read your data package documentation once it
is placed on a network (which is described in the section <a
 href="saving_to_network_synchronizing.htm">Uploading and Downloading
Data Packages</a>).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may then specify specific people and detail the permission
you wish to grant them for the data package. Click "Add" if you wish
to specify access rights for these people.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img height="473" width="735"
 src="images/dpwscreen15.gif"></p>
      <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Defining the people and their access rights is accomplished on
the screen pictured below. Begin by browsing through the list of
groups and users on the left of the screen. You can expand the list
by clicking on the plus sign next to the group, or shrink the list
back to its original form by clicking refresh at the bottom of the
screen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After selecting a specific user, you will be prompted to type
in
their name, organization,and email address. Next, define their
access permissions on the right of the screen. Choose Allow or
Deny, and then Read, Read and Write, Read and Write and Change
Permissions, or All from the drop down menus. If you are unsure
about what each of these means, read the description of each at the
bottom of the screen. Click "OK" when you are finished defining
access for one user.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>You may define access for additional users by clicking "Add"
again on the screen pictured above. As before, you can also edit,
delete, or change the ordering of entries you have made by using
the buttons on the right of the screen pictured above. Click "Next"
when finished.</p>
