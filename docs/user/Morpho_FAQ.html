        then open the file "index.html" in your browser (usually by double clicking
        on the file name). This will display the same help files as you would
        see when using
        Morpho's Help menu. The Morpho User Guide,
        found under the "Help" menu, contains information on a variety of topics
        and uses of Morpho. Examine the index of the Morpho User Guide to determine
        where to find information you need. Also, check the Frequently Asked
        Questions section for answers to some of the more common questions. If

    my local data packages when I upgrade to a newer version of Morpho?</font></b><font size="+1"><br>
    <br>
    If you have used a previous version of Morpho, then you may have local data
    packages stored in a &quot;profiles&quot; directory
    inside the main Morpho data directory. The location where the "profiles" directory
    is created and accessed is in a subdirectory
    within the user's "home" directory. On Windows 2000 or XP machines, the
    home directory is named after the user name (e.g. "higgins") and is located
    inside the &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; folder, usually under C:\. A
    directory named &quot;.morpho&quot; is created inside the user's
    home directory and the new &quot;profiles&quot; subdirectory
    is created there when Morpho is first
    executed. There is a subdirectory under &quot;profiles&quot; with the profile name
    and another subdirectory under that with the name &quot;data&quot; where local data
    for that profile is actually stored. Note that this is (usually) not
    the same directory as the one where the Morpho executable is installed. You
    should
    thus be able
    to uninstall Morpho and update it to newer versions without fear of losing
    any locally stored data packages.</font></p>

  <br>
  Complex, geospatially indexed images can be included and described in eml 2.0
  and newer versions using the "spatialRaster" or "spatialVector" entity
  modules.&nbsp; However, Morpho currently has no features directly supporting
  these modules. Later versions of Morpho will have this feature. Nevertheless,
  images that are stored in .gif or .jpeg formats (standards for web
  pages) can be added to data packages as "dataTable" elements (even though they
  are not really &quot;dataTables&quot;). To add such an image to an existing
  package using the "Create/Import New Datatable..." command under the "Data" menu.
  Choose the "Import" and then "Manual" radio buttons. Then select the image
  file that you wish to include. Then click the "Next" button.&nbsp; Select the "Non-text
  or proprietary formatted file" radio
  button and then select "other".&nbsp; You should then type "image", ".gif", ".jpeg",
  or ".jpg" in the text box below the "other" button. This tells Morpho to display
  the data as an image when the package is viewed later. Then continue through
  the Wizard as with any other data file. You will need to fill out at least
  the minimal information
  indicated on several of the next screens.</font></p>

      <td><p><b><font size="+1"><a name="lookandfeel"></a>4. Can I customize Morpho in any way?<br>
          </font></b><font size="+1"><br>
          In Morph 1.4.0 and later versions,
          there is a "Set preferences..." menu item in the "File" menu. That
          menu allows the user to change the look and feel of the Morpho windows,
          as well as change other options. However, in versions 1.3 and earlier,
          there is no command within the Morpho program to set any preferences,
          therefore you would need to set them manually, as described below:</font></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><font size="+1">There are some preferences (and additional
      data) that are read from the &quot;config.xml&quot; file that is stored in the ".morpho" directory
      in the user's home directory. Only a few of these should be set by the
      user. These include:<br>
      <br>
&lt;lookAndFeel&gt;&lt;/lookAndFeel&gt; &nbsp;--- &nbsp;As shown on the left,
    there is nothing between the pair of "lookAndFeel" tags in the default config.xml
    file. This causes the look of the Morpho display to mimic that of the current
    operating system - e.g. Windows, Mac, etc. You can see a different look by changing
    the tag set to be "&lt;lookAndFeel&gt;kunststoff&lt;/lookAndFeel&gt;". This will
    cause a variety of minor changes in the look of buttons, scroll bars, etc. The "kunststoff" is
    a customized look-and-feel created for Java applications.<br>
      <br>
&lt;log_file&gt;false&lt;/log_file&gt; --- Changing the value within these tags
    from "false" to "true" will send all error messages to a log file. This may
    be useful if you are having problems.&nbsp; Note that in version 1.5 and
    later, the default setting for this parameter has been set to "true". Messages
    are thus automatically written to the log file (which is written to the Morpho
    startup
    directory and
    called "stderr.log"). If problems occur, this log file can be examined (or
    sent to the Morpho developers) to help determine the cause of the problem.
    Note that
    the log file is rewritten every time Morpho starts up, so you will need to
    rename it&nbsp; if you want to save the results.</font></p>

          There may be some confusion because the Export command asks you to
    select a "directory", not a file. Select a directory where you want the package
    exported to. On the Mac, you may need to actually type in the name of directory
    after selecting its parent directory. The exported metadata and data (if
    your data package includes data) will be exported to the directory you selected.</font></p>

          <br>
          Morpho sends a number of messages about operations that are normally
            not visible when you start Morpho using the icons created by the
              installer. On a Windows
  machine, the program that normally launches
  Morpho is called "Morpho.exe". An alternate method for launching Morpho (Windows
  only) is to execute the batch file "morpho.bat" which is located in the directory
  where Morpho was installed. When launched using the batch file, a background
  command window will appear and a number of messages will appear in this window
  while Morpho is running. These can give you hints about problems. You can also
  see all these messages in a log file that is created when the "&lt;log_file&gt;" parameter
  is set to "true" in
  the configuration file
  (see <a href="#lookandfeel">FAQ question #4</a> for instructions on accessing
  the config.xml file).</font></p>

          <br>
          For reasonable performance, a fairly new computer system is recommended
            (i.e. a clock speed or 700MHz or greater and 256 MB of RAM or greater).
            Morpho will
  run on slower systems with less RAM, but some operations
  may be very slow.&nbsp; More RAM is especially useful if there are a large
  number of local data packages, since the local data is cached in RAM at startup.
  Some
  operations will require several minutes to complete even on newer computers.
  One example is the initial display of
  very large (10s of MB) data files.</font></p>

              <br>
              One can simply paste data from the clipboard into a data file displayed
              in Morpho. However, currently Morpho does not automatically add
              rows to the data file when
  information is pasted. Thus, if you want to add data, you will need to create
  additional rows before pasting the new data. Select the last row and then use
  the "Data" menu, the popup menu you get when you right-click on the data table,
  or press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;i&gt; to insert a new empty row. When enough rows
  have been created, you can select the top empty row and paste new data. Note
  that
  the default when copying/pasting from Excel is tab-delimited data. All the
  data will end up in the first cell if the data being pasted uses a different
  delimiter
  that the existing data (e.g. pasting from
  Excel when the existing data is comma-delimited). Alternately, you may add
  data using the Data Table Wizard, explained in the <a href="Adding_Data_to_a_Data_Package.htm">Adding
  Data to a Data Package</a>  section.</font></p>

    6".&nbsp; Morpho versions 1.5 and later will still read these older packages,
    but it will automatically convert them to the newer EML 2.0 (or later versions
    of EML) format for display. These
    older data packages will
    not be converted to EML 2.0 (or later) until the owner saves them, at which

        <p class="tablepanel"><font size="+1">Note that at this time, Morpho

            For data files saved in other formats, you can often change that
            format into text format. For example, if you have data tables created
            in Microsoft Access, you can click on each datatable in that database
            and export it as a text file (under File -&gt; Export...). These
            text files can then be added one at a time to Morpho, and the documentation
            extracted automatically. If you have data in an Excel workbook, you
            can simply save each data sheet as a text file using &quot;Save As&quot; and
            choosing a text format from the &quot;Save as type&quot; menu. Chart
            objects in Excel cannot be saved as text files. Also, documentation
            cannot be automatically extracted from image files. For these and

          package locally (or back to the network after making edits). One difference
