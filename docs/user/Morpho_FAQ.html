        see when using
        Morpho's Help menu. The Morpho User Guide,
        found under the &quot;Help&quot; menu, contains information on a variety of topics
        and uses of Morpho. Examine the index of the Morpho User Guide to determine
        where to find information you need. Also, check the Frequently Asked

            <br>
Morpho sends a number of messages about operations that are normally not visible when you start Morpho using the icons created by the installer. On a Windows machine, the program that normally launches Morpho is called &quot;Morpho.exe&quot;. An alternate method for launching Morpho (Windows only) is to execute the batch file &quot;morpho.bat&quot; which is located in the directory where Morpho was installed. When launched using the batch file, a background command window will appear and a number of messages will appear in this window while Morpho is running. These can give you hints about problems. You can also see all these messages in a log file that is created when the &quot;&lt;log_file&gt;&quot; parameter is set to &quot;true&quot; in the configuration file (see <a href="#lookandfeel">question #4</a> for instructions on accessing the config.xml file).</p>

            <br>
For reasonable performance, a fairly new computer system is recommended (i.e. a clock speed or 700MHz or greater and 256 MB of RAM or greater). Morpho will run on slower systems with less RAM, but some operations may be very slow.&nbsp; More RAM is especially useful if there are a large number of local data packages, since the local data is cached in RAM at startup. Some operations will require several minutes to complete even on newer computers. One example is the initial display of very large (10s of MB) data files.</p>

      <td><p><b><a name="lookandfeel"></a>4. Can I customize Morpho in any way?<br>
          </b><br>
          In Morph 1.4.0 and later versions,
          there is a &quot;Set preferences...&quot; menu item in the &quot;File&quot; menu. That
          menu allows the user to change the look and feel of the Morpho windows,
          as well as change other options. However, in versions 1.3 and earlier,
          there is no command within the Morpho program to set any preferences,
          therefore you would need to set them manually, as described below:</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>There are some preferences (and additional
      data) that are read from the &quot;config.xml&quot; file that is stored in the &quot;.morpho&quot; directory
      in the user's home directory. Only a few of these should be set by the
      user. These include:<br>
      <br>
&lt;lookAndFeel&gt;&lt;/lookAndFeel&gt; &nbsp;--- &nbsp;As shown on the left,
    there is nothing between the pair of &quot;lookAndFeel&quot; tags in the default config.xml
    file. This causes the look of the Morpho display to mimic that of the current
    operating system - e.g. Windows, Mac, etc. You can see a different look by changing
    the tag set to be &quot;&lt;lookAndFeel&gt;kunststoff&lt;/lookAndFeel&gt;&quot;. This will
    cause a variety of minor changes in the look of buttons, scroll bars, etc. The &quot;kunststoff&quot; is
    a customized look-and-feel created for Java applications.<br>
      <br>
&lt;log_file&gt;false&lt;/log_file&gt; --- Changing the value within these tags
    from &quot;false&quot; to &quot;true&quot; will send all error messages to a log file. This may
    be useful if you are having problems.&nbsp; Note that in version 1.5 and
    later, the default setting for this parameter has been set to &quot;true&quot;. Messages
    are thus automatically written to the log file (which is written to the Morpho
    startup
    directory and
    called &quot;stderr.log&quot;). If problems occur, this log file can be examined (or
    sent to the Morpho developers) to help determine the cause of the problem.
    Note that
    the log file is rewritten every time Morpho starts up, so you will need to
    rename it&nbsp; if you want to save the results.</p>

          <br>
If you have used a previous version of Morpho, then you may have local data packages stored in a &quot;profiles&quot; directory inside the main Morpho data directory. The location where the &quot;profiles&quot; directory is created and accessed is in a subdirectory within the user's &quot;home&quot; directory. On Windows 2000 or XP machines, the home directory is named after the user name (e.g. &quot;smith&quot;) and is located inside the &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; folder, usually under C:\. A directory named &quot;.morpho&quot; is created inside the user's home directory and the new &quot;profiles&quot; subdirectory is created there when Morpho is first executed. There is a subdirectory under &quot;profiles&quot; with the profile name and another subdirectory under that with the name &quot;data&quot; where local data for that profile are actually stored. Note that this is (usually) not the same directory as the one where the Morpho executable is installed. You should thus be able to uninstall Morpho and update it to newer versions without fear of losing any locally stored data packages.</p>

        <p class="tablepanel">Note that at this time, Morpho can only extract documentation from a data file that is in text format. For data files saved in other formats, you can often change that format into text format. For example, if you have data tables created in Microsoft Access, you can click on each data table in that database and export it as a text file (under File -&gt; Export...). These text files can then be added one at a time to Morpho, and the documentation extracted automatically. If you have data in an Excel workbook, you can simply save each worksheet as a text file using &quot;Save As&quot; and choosing the &quot;Text (Tab-delimited)&quot; format from the &quot;Save as type&quot; menu. Chart objects in Excel cannot be saved as text files. Also, documentation cannot be automatically extracted from image files. For these and other types of data files, you should manually enter their documentation in the New Data table Wizard.</p>

              <br>
              One can simply paste data from the clipboard into a data table displayed
              in Morpho. However, currently Morpho does not automatically add
              rows to the data table when
  information is pasted. Thus, if you want to add data, you will need to create
  additional rows before pasting the new data. Select the last row and then use
  the &quot;Data&quot; menu, the pop-up menu you get when you right-click on the data table,
  or press CTRL-I to insert a new empty row. When enough rows
  have been created, you can select the top empty row and paste new data. Note
  that
  the default when copying/pasting from Excel is tab-delimited data. All the
  data will end up in the first cell if the data being pasted uses a different
  delimiter
  that the existing data (e.g. pasting from
  Excel when the existing data is comma-delimited). Alternatively, you may add
  data using the New Data Table Wizard, explained in the <a href="Adding_Data_to_a_Data_Package.htm">Adding
  Data to a Data Package</a>  section.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>If your information about the taxonomic coverage is extensive, you can import this information in the form of a table instead of typing it into the Taxonomic Coverage section of the New Data Package Wizard. For example, if your taxonomic information constitutes a list of species, save this list as a text file. Once you have completed the New Data Package Wizard to create your data package, go to the &quot;Data&quot; menu and click on &quot;Create/Import New Data table&quot;. Click on &quot;IMPORT&quot; and &quot;AUTOMATIC&quot;, and locate your text file on your computer. Complete the rest of the New Data Table Wizard (you might need to uncheck the space delimiter box in step #2 of the wizard to fit your species names in a single column). If needed, see the <a href="Adding_Data_to_a_Data_Package.htm">Adding Data to a Data Package</a> section for more information on the New Data Table Wizard. Go to the &quot;Documentation&quot; menu, click on &quot;Taxonomic Coverage&quot;, and click on the &quot;Import Taxon Information from Data table&quot; link.

        <br>
Complex, geospatially indexed images can be included and described in eml 2.0 and newer versions using the &quot;spatialRaster&quot; or &quot;spatialVector&quot; entity modules.&nbsp; However, Morpho currently has no features directly supporting these modules. Later versions of Morpho will have this feature. Nevertheless, images that are stored in .gif or .jpeg formats (standards for web pages) can be added to data packages as &quot;dataTable&quot; elements (even though they are not really &quot;dataTables&quot;). To add such an image to an existing package using the &quot;Create/Import New Data table...&quot; command under the &quot;Data&quot; menu. Choose the &quot;Import&quot; and then &quot;Manual&quot; radio buttons. Then select the image file that you wish to include. Then click the &quot;Next&quot; button.&nbsp; Select the &quot;Non-text or proprietary formatted file&quot; radio button and then select &quot;other&quot;.&nbsp; You should then type &quot;image&quot;, &quot;.gif&quot;, &quot;.jpeg&quot;, or &quot;.jpg&quot; in the text box below the &quot;other&quot; button. This tells Morpho to display the data as an image when the package is viewed later. Then continue through the Wizard as with any other data file. You will need to fill out at least the minimal information indicated on several of the next screens.</p>

      data package and saving a data package to the network?</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>When synchronizing a data package, you can either save
          a local copy of a data package to the network, or save a copy of a data
              package from the network to your local machine. Synchronizing will
              make the network
              and your
              local
          machine have the same copy (of the data package(s) you choose to synchronize).
          When saving a data package, you can essentially achieve the same result
          as synchronizing. You can save a local data package to the network (as
              well as locally after making edits), or you can save a network data
              package locally (or back to the network after making edits). One difference
              between the two choices is that the synchronize command is made available
              when you right-click on a data package in a search results box,
              whereas the save command is only available after you have opened a
              data package. </p>

          Previous versions of Morpho worked with a now obsolete version of EML called &quot;Beta 6&quot;.&nbsp; Morpho versions 1.5 and later will still read these older packages, but it will automatically convert them to the newer EML 2.0 (or later versions of EML) format for display. These older data packages will not be converted to EML 2.0 (or later) until the owner saves them, at which time a new ID will also be assigned.</p>

        <br>
      </strong>There is no direct way in Morpho to delete a saved search. One can, however, look in the .morpho/profiles/&lt;profilename&gt; directory and delete the &quot;queries&quot; subdirectory (or one of the files in it) to remove all queries (or one of them).</p>

      <td><p><a name="profiledelete"></a><strong>15. How do I delete a profile?<br>
        <br>
      </strong>There is no method for deleting an old profile that you no longer need in Morpho itself. Instead, you delete the file (saved on your computer) that corresponds with the profile you would like to delete. These profile files are located in the profiles folder, which can be found in the &quot;.morpho&quot; folder. Delete the entire profile folder for the profile you wish to delete - be warned however that by deleting the profile folder you are also deleting all the local copies of data packages that were created or saved using that profile. Therefore data loss may happen unless you have previously extracted the data package and saved it elsewhere on your computer, or unless you have saved the data package to a network server, like metacat.</p>

            <br>
      There may be some confusion because the Export command asks you to select a &quot;directory&quot;, not a file. Select a directory where you want the package exported to. On the Mac, you may need to actually type in the name of directory after selecting its parent directory. The exported metadata and data (if your data package includes data) will be exported to the directory you selected.</p>

        <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="tablepanel">In Morpho, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ctrl-X to cut text.</li>
          <li>Ctrl-C to copy text.</li>
          <li>Ctrl-V to paste text.</li>
          <li>Ctrl-I to insert table rows one at a time into a data table (see <a href="#pastedata">question #8</a> for more detail).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tablepanel">In the New Data Package Wizard, you can also use the following keys to quickly navigate through the wizard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Left and right arrows take you forward and back through the steps in the wizard. &quot;Esc&quot; exits the wizard. &quot;Tab&quot; allows you to move from one field to the next.</li>
          <li>&quot;Enter&quot; brings you to the next required field, and can also be used to open new windows (such as the owners window in step 5 of the New Data Package Wizard).</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Additional keyboard shortcuts may be implemented in later versions of Morpho.</p></td>
