      <b>1. How do I get help?<br>
      <br>
      </b>If Morpho is running, you should be able to  use the &quot;Help&quot; menu located
      at the top of each window. You can also open the "docs/user" directory
      in the directory where Morpho was installed and then open the file "index.html" in
      your browser (usually by double clicking on the file name). This will
      display
      the
      same help
      files as you would see when using Morpho's Help menu. The Morpho User Guide,
      found under the &quot;Help&quot; menu, contains information on a variety of topics
      and uses of Morpho. Examine the index to determine where to get help.<br>
        <b><br>
  2. What happened to my local data packages when I upgraded to Morpho
  1.2?</b><br>
  <br>
  If you have used a previous version of Morpho, then you may have local data
  packages stored in a &quot;profiles&quot; directory inside the main Morpho directory.
  The location
  where the &quot;profiles&quot; directory is created and accessed in Version 1.2 has been
  changed from the Morpho install directory to a subdirectory within the user's
  &quot;home&quot; directory. [On Windows 2000 or XP machines, the home directory is named
  after the user name (e.g. &quot;higgins&quot;) and is located inside the &quot;Documents and
  Settings&quot; folder, usually under C:\] A directory named &quot;.morpho&quot; is created
  inside the user's home directory and the new profiles directory is created
  there when
  Morpho is first executed. To access previously created data packages, copy
  those packages from your existing profiles directory to the profiles directory
  inside
  the &lt;home&gt;/.morpho
  directory.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="image"></a>3. How can I add an image to my data package?</b><br>
  <br>
  Images that are stored in .gif or .jpeg formats (standards for web pages)
  can be added to data packages. To add such an image, either create a new package
  using the "New Datapackage..." menu item (under
  the "File" menu) or add an image to an existing package using the "Create New
  Datatable..." command under the "Data" menu. On the wizard screen that asks
  for a data file to be included in the package, select the image file that you
  wish
  to include and then click the button that
  says "Manually enter data file descriptions.". Then click the "Next" button.
  You will then need to fill out at least the minimal information indicated on
  several of the next screens. After filling out several screens you will come
  to a screen labeled "Data Physical
  Information" where the one required field is named "Format". You should then
  type "image", ".gif", ".jpeg", or ".jpg" in the Format text box. This tells
  Morpho to display the data as an image when the package is viewed later. Then
  continue
  through the Wizard as with any
  other data file.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="lookandfeel"></a>4. Can I customize Morpho in any way?<br>
  </b><br>
  In versions 1.3 and earlier,. there is no command within the Morpho program
  to set any preferences. (In Morph 1.4.0, there is a &quot;Set preferences...&quot; menu
  item in the
  &quot;File&quot; menu. That menu item makes it unnecessary to change the configuration
  file as described here.) There are some preferences (and additional data) that
  are read from the 'config.xml' file that is stored in the &quot;.morpho&quot; directory
  in the user's home directory. Only a few of these should be set by the user.
  These include:<br>
  <br>
&lt;lookAndFeel&gt;&lt;/lookAndFeel&gt; &nbsp;--- &nbsp;As shown on the left,
  there is nothing between the pair of &quot;lookAndFeel&quot; tags in the default config.xml
  file. This causes the look of the Morpho display to mimic that of the current
  operating system - e.g. Windows, Mac, etc. You can see a different look by
changing the tag set to be "&lt;lookAndFeel&gt;kunststoff&lt;/lookAndFeel&gt;".
This will cause a variety of minor changes in the look of buttons, scroll bars,
  etc. The
  &quot;kunststoff&quot; is a customized look-and-feel created for Java
  applications.<br>
  <br>
&lt;log_file&gt;false&lt;/log_file&gt; --- Changing the value within these tags
  from &quot;false&quot; to &quot;true&quot; will send all error messages to a log file. This may
be useful if you are having problems.<br>
  <br>
&lt;metacat_url&gt;http://metacat.nceas.ucsb.edu/knb/servlet/metacat&lt;/metacat_url&gt; ---
  The url of the network server where data is stored is set here. You may need
  to change this if you are using a custom server.<br>
  <br>
  <b><a name="export"></a>5. How can I &quot;Export&quot; a datapackage? The Export menu item doesn't seem to
  work</b>.<br>
  <br>
  There may be some confusion because the Export command asks you to select a "directory",
  not a file. Select a directory where you want the package exported to. On the
  Mac, you may need to actually type in the name of directory after selecting
  its parent directory.<br>
  <br>
  <b>6. How can I get more information on problems?</b><br>
  <br>
  Morpho sends a number of messages about operations that are normally not visible
  when you start Morpho using the icons created by the installer. On a Windows
  machine, the program that normally launches
  Morpho is called "Morpho.exe". An alternate method for launching Morpho (Windows
  only) is to execute the batch file "morpho.bat" which is located in the directory
  where Morpho was installed. When launched using the batch file, a background
  command window will appear and a number messages will appear in this window
  while Morpho is running. You can also see all these messages in a log file
  that is
  created when
  the &quot;&lt;log_file&gt;&quot; parameter is set to &quot;true&quot; in the configuration
  file (see <a href="#lookandfeel">FAQ question #4</a>).<br>
  <br>
  <b>7. What are the system requirements for running Morpho?</b><br>
  <br>
  For reasonable performance, a fairly new computer system is recommended (i.e.
  a clock speed or 700MHz or greater and 256 MB of RAM or greater). Morpho will
  run on slower systems with less RAM, but some operations
  may be very slow.&nbsp; More RAM is especially useful of there are a large
  number of local data packages, since the local data is cached in RAM at startup.
  Some
  operations will require several minutes to complete even on newer computers.
  One example is the initial display of
  very large (10s of MB) data files.<br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="pastedata"></a>8. How can I add data to a data file?</span><br>
  <br>
  One can simply paste data from the clipboard into a data file displayed in
  Morpho. However, currently Morpho does not automatically add rows to the data
  file when
  information is pasted. Thus, if you want to add data, you will need to create
  additional rows before pasting the new data. Select the last row and then use
  the &quot;Data&quot; menu, the popup menu you get when you right-click on the data table,
  or press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;i&gt; to insert a new empty row. When enough rows
  have been created, you can select the top empty row and paste new data. Note
  that
  the default when copying/pasting from Excel is tab-delimited data. All the
  data will end up in the first cell if the data being pasted uses a different
  delimiter
  that the existing data
  (e.g. pasting from Excel when the existing data is comma-delimited.).</p>
