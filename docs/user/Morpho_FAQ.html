              use the "Help" menu located
              at the top of each window. You can also open the "docs/user" directory
              in the directory where Morpho was installed and
        then open the file "index.html" in your browser (usually by double clicking on
        the file name). This will display the same help files as you would see when using
        Morpho's Help menu. The Morpho User Guide,
        found under the "Help" menu, contains information on a variety of topics and
        uses of Morpho. Examine the index to determine where to get
        help.</font></p>

    <br>
    If you have used a previous version of Morpho, then you may have local data
    packages stored in a "<span style="font-family: monospace;">profiles</span>" directory
    inside the main Morpho data directory. The location where the "profiles" directory
    is created and accessed is in a subdirectory
    within the user's "home" directory. [On Windows 2000 or XP machines, the home
    directory is named after the user name (e.g. "higgins") and is located inside
    the "<span style="font-family: monospace;">Documents and
    Settings</span>" folder, usually under <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">C:\</span>] A directory named "<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">.morpho</span>" is created inside the user's
    home directory and the new <span style="font-family: monospace;">"profiles" </span>subdirectory
    is created there when Morpho is first
    executed. There is a subdirectory under <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">"profiles" </span>with the profile name and
    another subdirectory under that with the name <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">"data"</span> where local data for that profile
    is actually stored .&nbsp; Note that this is (usually) not the same directory
    as the one where the Morpho executable is installed. You should thus be able
    to uninstall Morpho and update it to newer versions without fear of losing
    any locally stored data packages.</font></p>

  <br>
  Complex, geospatially indexed images can be included and described in eml 2.0
  using the "spatialRaster" or "spatialVector" entitiy
  modules.&nbsp; However, Morpho currently has no features directly supporting
  these modules. Nevertheless, images that are stored in .gif or .jpeg formats
  (standards for web
  pages) can be added to data packages as "dataTable" elements (even though they
  are not really &quot;dataTables&quot;). To add such an image to an existing package using
  the "Create/Import New Datatable..." command under the "Data" menu. Choose
  the "Import" and then "Manual" radio buttons Then select the image file that
  you wish to include. Then click the "Next" button.&nbsp; Select the "Non-text
  or proprietary formatted file" radio
  button and then select "other".&nbsp; You should then type "image", ".gif", ".jpeg",
  or ".jpg" in the text box below the "other" button. This tells Morpho to display
  the data as an image when the package is viewed later. Then continue through
  the Wizard as with any other data file. You will need to fill out at least
  the minimal information
  indicated on several of the next screens.</font></p>

      <td><p><b><font size="+1"><a name="lookandfeel"></a>4. Can I customize Morpho in any way?<br>
          </font></b><font size="+1"><br>
          In versions 1.3 and earlier,. there is no command within the Morpho
            program to set any preferences. (In Morph 1.4.0, there is a "Set preferences..." menu
  item in the "File" menu. That menu item makes it unnecessary to change the
  configuration file as described here.) There are some preferences (and additional
  data) that are read from the 'config.xml' file that is stored in the ".morpho" directory
  in the user's home directory. Only a few of these should be set by the user.
  These include:<br>
  <br>
&lt;lookAndFeel&gt;&lt;/lookAndFeel&gt; &nbsp;--- &nbsp;As shown on the left,
there is nothing between the pair of "lookAndFeel" tags in the default config.xml
file. This causes the look of the Morpho display to mimic that of the current
operating system - e.g. Windows, Mac, etc. You can see a different look by changing
the tag set to be "&lt;lookAndFeel&gt;kunststoff&lt;/lookAndFeel&gt;". This will
cause a variety of minor changes in the look of buttons, scroll bars, etc. The "kunststoff" is
a customized look-and-feel created for Java applications.<br>
  <br>
&lt;log_file&gt;false&lt;/log_file&gt; --- Changing the value within these tags
from "false" to "true" will send all error messages to a log file. This may be
useful if you are having problems.&nbsp; Note that in version 1.5, the default
setting for this parameter has been set to "true". Messages are thus automatically
written to the log file (which is written to the Morpho startup directory and
called "stderr.log"). If problems occur, this log file can be examined (or sent
to the Morpho developers) to help determine the cause of the problem. Note that
the log file is rewritten every time Morpho starts up, so you will need to rename
it&nbsp; if you want to save the results.</font></p>

      The url of the network server where data is stored is set here. You may
        need to change this if you are using a custom server.</font></p>

          There may be some confusion because the Export command asks you to
    select a "directory", not a file. Select a directory where you want the package
    exported to. On the Mac, you may need to actually type in the name of directory
    after selecting its parent directory.</font></p>

          <br>
          Morpho sends a number of messages about operations that are normally
            not visible when you start Morpho using the icons created by the
              installer. On a Windows
  machine, the program that normally launches
  Morpho is called "Morpho.exe". An alternate method for launching Morpho (Windows
  only) is to execute the batch file "morpho.bat" which is located in the directory
  where Morpho was installed. When launched using the batch file, a background
  command window will appear and a number of messages will appear in this window
  while Morpho is running. You can also see all these messages in a log file that
  is created when the "&lt;log_file&gt;" parameter is set to "true" in the configuration
  file
  (see <a href="#lookandfeel">FAQ question #4</a>).</font></p>

          For reasonable performance, a fairly new computer system is recommended
            (i.e. a clock speed or 700MHz or greater and 256 MB of RAM or greater).
            Morpho will
  run on slower systems with less RAM, but some operations
  may be very slow.&nbsp; More RAM is especially useful if there are a large
  number of local data packages, since the local data is cached in RAM at startup.
  Some
  operations will require several minutes to complete even on newer computers.
  One example is the initial display of
  very large (10s of MB) data files.</font></p>

              <br>
              One can simply paste data from the clipboard into a data file displayed
              in Morpho. However, currently Morpho does not automatically add
              rows to the data file when
  information is pasted. Thus, if you want to add data, you will need to create
  additional rows before pasting the new data. Select the last row and then use
  the "Data" menu, the popup menu you get when you right-click on the data table,
  or press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;i&gt; to insert a new empty row. When enough rows
  have been created, you can select the top empty row and paste new data. Note
  that
  the default when copying/pasting from Excel is tab-delimited data. All the
  data will end up in the first cell if the data being pasted uses a different
  delimiter
  that the existing data (e.g. pasting from
  Excel when the existing data is comma-delimited).</font></p>

                Previous versions of Morpho worked with a now obsolete version
                of EML called "Beta
    6".&nbsp; Morpho 1.5 will still read these older packages, but it will automatically
    convert them to the newer EML 2.0 format for display. These older data packages&nbsp; will
    not be converted to EML 2.0 until the owner saves them, at which time a new
    ID will also be assigned.</font></p>
