  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2" width="50%"><p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>There are two main reasons you may wish to
        edit a data package. First, you may want to add additional documentation
        to the data package documentation, that was not available in the <a href="Creating_a_new_data_package.htm#dpw">Data
        Package Wizard</a>. Second, you may want to change or delete documentation that you
        entered in the Data Package Wizard, or that you added to the data package
        documentation in some other way. For either of these purposes, you will
        use the Morpho Editor. Its functions and uses are described here.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="helpsub"><a name="editor"></a>Morpho Editor</p>
      <p>Begin by <a href="opening_a_data_package.htm">opening the data package</a> you
        wish to edit. Next, open Morpho Editor by doing one of the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Under the &quot;Data&quot; menu, choose &quot;Add Documentation&quot;.</li>
        <li>On the upper right side of the data package documentation, click on
          the &quot;Edit&quot; button. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You will then see the Morpho Editor, pictured below.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/editor1.gif" width="712" height="484"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Each type of data documentation document (i.e. each metadata type) has
        some structure which is indicated by the hierarchical outline on the
        left. By clicking on the &quot;+&quot; symbol next to a category, you can browse
        through the hierarchy, viewing &quot;parent&quot; and &quot;child&quot; nodes. Parent nodes
        are the higher level nodes, and child nodes are the sub-level nodes.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Items
            in the outline are color coded to indicate which items are required
          and which
            can be
            repeated.
            The legend
            for this
            color-coding
          is found at the bottom-left of the screen. Blue and red nodes in the
        hierarchy are required, while green and yellow nodes are optional. Blue
        and green nodes
        are repeatable,
        meaning they can be duplicated (for example, there can be multiple data
        set owners), while red nodes can only be used once, and yellow nodes
        can be used once or not at all (zero).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Initially, only the documentation types that already exist in the data
        package documentation are displayed in the list. When an item is selected
        in this outline, a form based view of the information contained in the
        selected item is shown on the right side of the window. You may navigate
        your way to a desired field that you would like to edit by clicking on
        the plus symbols next to the documentation types. Alternatively, you can
        scroll through the fields shown on the right half of the screen by using
        the scroll bar.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Most of the fields on the right side of the editor screen are editable.
        One can just click on the field of interest and enter text. The 'tab
        key' will move the selection to the next editable field.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To add additional documentation for types that are not shown initially
        in the tree on the left of the screen, click the &quot;Show All&quot; button.
        This will cause all of the documentation types to be displayed. To get
        back to the original view, click &quot;Trim&quot;.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To expand and view all of the levels of the tree, click on the &quot;+&quot; button
        at the top left of the screen. All parents and their children will be
        displayed. To contract the levels of the tree, click the &quot;-&quot; button.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>A right-click on any item in the outline displays a popup menu (as
        shown below) which allows the user to choose among several options. These
        include duplicating an item, deleting an item, or copy and pasting items.
        Note that all of these operations will include not only the selected
        item, but also all of the item's children, or sub-levels, in the indicated
        hierarchy. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/editor2.gif" width="712" height="484"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>To navigate quickly through the tree, you can find a section of documentation
        by choosing it from the drop down list located at the top left of the
        screen, next to &quot;Find:&quot;.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>After making any desired changes or additions to the documentation,
        click &quot;Finish&quot; at the bottom right of the screen to accept
        the changes. You will then see the changes displayed in the data package
        documentation. If you want to cancel the changes or additions made in
        the Morpho Editor, click &quot;Revert&quot;. Revert will undo all changes
        that have been made to the documentation since the Morpho Editor was
        opened.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span class="helpsub"><a name="technical"></a>Technical Notes</span><br>
  For those who are interested in technical details, the Morpho editor is an
    XML editor. It works by first reading an XML file and building an outline
    (tree) view of the XML document. XML files can have formalized templates
    called &quot;DTD's&quot;, which describe how the document can be constructed. If the
    XML document indicates that its structure should conform to a DTD, then the
    DTD is scanned and a single instance of any optional nodes not present in
    the original is added to the hierarchy. Finally, if the editor has additional
    data about the document type, it will add that data as custom displays or
    help information about the node, as is shown in the above examples. The editor
    can thus be customized to display the XML data in a variety of ways.</p>
