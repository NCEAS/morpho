<td ROWSPAN="2" WIDTH="50%">After the Connection Dialog is closed (either
by Connecting or clicking the Cancel button) the main Morpho window will
appear. This window should resemble the one shown below. This screen is
labeled "My Data (higgins)" where 'higgins' will be replaced by the current
user name. The window displays all the data packages 'owned' by the current
user. When Morpho is used for the first time there will be a single entry
in the table, as indicated below. This is a example of a fictitious data
package created to help the new user. After the user has created his/her
own datapackages, they will all appear on this screen when Morpho is started
up.&nbsp;

<p>After the user has created several data packages, this 'My Data' screen
will have a number of rows in the table as shown below.

Created&nbsp;<br><br>
<p>Each row in the table represents a "Data Package". This data package
consists of a collection of data and various descriptions of that data
(i.e. metadata). You can get more details about the data package by 'double
clicking' on the row of interest. Also, clicking the right mouse button
while over a row will bring up a popup menu that allows the user to operate
on the selected data package.</td>

<p>
You can control your data packages by right clicking on them.  When you right
click on a package, a menu is shown that gives you options to move your package
from your local machine to a Metacat server (or visa versa), to delete your package
or to open your package.
</p>
<img src="uploadtometacat.jpg">
<p>If a file is located only on your local machine (denoted by the file folder
icon on the left side) you can upload it to your Metacat server by right clicking
and choosing 'Upload to Metacat' from the menu.</p>
<img src="downloadfrommetacat.jpg">
<p>If a package is located only on your Metacat server (denoted by the butterfly
icon on the left side) you can download it to your
local machine by right clicking on the package and choosing 'Download from Metacat'
from the menu. Note that if both the folder icon and the butterfly icon are present,
you cannot upload or download the package because it is already in both locations.
</p>
<p>The other options you can use from this menu include:
  <ul>
    <li>Delete Metacat Copy: Deletes the package from the Metacat server only.</li>
    <li>Delete Local Copy: Deletes the package from your local computer only.</li>
    <li>Delete Both Copies: Deletes the package completely from both the Metacat
    server and from your local computer</li>
    <li>Open: performs the same action as double clicking, opening the package 
    in the <a href="package.html#packageeditor">Package Editor</a></li>
    <li>Refresh: refreshes the results screen</li>
