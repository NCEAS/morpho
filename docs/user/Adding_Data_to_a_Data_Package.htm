      <p>There are two alternate
        ways to add a data table to a data package in Morpho. One way is to click
        on &quot;or
      click here to finish this wizard and add a new data table now...&quot; at
      the end of the Data package Wizard, shown below.</p>      <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center" class="tablepanel"><img src="images/dpwscreen17.gif" width="711" height="438"></p>      <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="tablepanel">Alternatively, after creating a data
          package, you can select Create/Import New Data Table under the Data
        menu at the
          top
          of the window, shown below.</p>
      <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center" class="tablepanel"><img src="images/create_import_data.gif" width="711" height="435"></p>      <p class="helpsub">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="tablepanel">Either way you will see the New Data Table Wizard,
        which is described below. Throughout the New Data Package Wizard, items
        in <span class="required">red</span> are required. The first screen of the New Data
        Table Wizard is shown below. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/datawizard1.gif" width="650" height="467"></p>
      <p>&nbsp; </p>
      <p>Begin by choosing one of the three options to tell the wizard what you
        would like to do. Each of these is described below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#create">CREATE</a></li>
      </ul>            <p>An empty data table is created where you can type the data directly
        into Morpho. You also manually create documentation for the data table.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#import">IMPORT</a></li>
      </ul>            <p>An existing data file is imported into Morpho, and you create the documentation
        for the data using the wizard, either automatically or manually. </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#describe">DESCRIBE</a></li>
      </ul>      <p>The data are NOT included in the data package, but you create the documentation
        for the data using the wizard, either automatically or manually.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>      
      <p class="tablepanel">Depending on which of these first three options you
        choose, you will see different subsequent screens and provide different
        information throughout the New Data Table Wizard. 
        Each of these three alternate paths is described  below.</p>
      <p class="helpsub">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="helpsub">Create<a name="create"></a></p>            
      <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="tablepanel">File Format</p>
      <p class="tablepanel">If &quot;CREATE&quot; is selected in the screen pictured above,
        you will create a new data table that is empty, where you can type the
        data
        in
        later,
        and
        you will also create documentation (metadata) for the table. Clicking
        &quot;Next&quot; will bring you to the screen pictured below, where you
        indicate the format of your data.</p>      <p align="center"><a name="fileformat"></a><img src="images/datawizard11.gif" width="649" height="466"></p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">If the data is in a simple delimited text format, then
          choose the first option. You will then see the additional prompts shown
          below. Indicate if the data attributes are arranged in rows or columns.
          Then
          choose
          one
          or
          more
          delimiters
          used in the formatting to indicate where the end of  fields occur.          </p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>        <p align="center"><img src="images/datawizard7.gif" width="652" height="574"></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">If instead the data are in a complex text format, choose
          the second option. You will then see the additional prompts shown below.
          Indicate if the data attributes are arranged in rows or columns. You
          then can define whether the data contain fixed width fields, and
          if so what the width is, or of the data are delimited, and if so what
          the delimiter character is. You may add additional data structure documentation
          to this list, delete existing ones, or change the order of them, by
          using the buttons to the right of the screen.</p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/datawizard12.gif" width="649" height="578"></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>        
        <p align="left">If the data are not in simple delimited text format or
          in complex text format, but are instead a Microsoft Excel file, then
          choose the third option under &quot;What is the format of your data?&quot;. Additional
          prompts will then appear, shown in the screen pictured below. Choose
          one of the format types from the list. If the format of your data are
          not shown, then click &quot;Other&quot; and describe the format on the space
          provided.</p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/datawizard10.gif" width="731" height="589"></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>        
        <p align="left">Click &quot;Next&quot; when finished describing the
        file format. You will then see a screen which asks you to describe the
          data table, also known as an &quot;entity&quot;, pictured below.</p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><img src="images/datawizard13.gif" width="649" height="578"></p>        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left">Begin by typing the name of the table, which is required.
          Add a description of the entity (table) if desired. This will be helpful
          in informing future viewers of the data package abut the contents of
          the
          table, and will also serve to document the overall meaning of the table
          as well, and therefore adding a description is recommended. Next, you
          define the attributes of the data table in a number of ways. Only one
          attribute is required to be defined, but it is highly recommended that
          ALL attributes be defined. Click &quot;Add&quot; to define one of the
        attributes. You will then see the screen pictured below.</p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="center"><a name="defineattribute"></a><img src="images/datawizard14.gif" width="647" height="448"></p>
        <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>        
        <p class="tablepanel">Begin by naming the attribute (which is often simply
          a column in the data table, but not always), and providing a label
          for the attribute (which should be shorter than the name). In the &quot;Definition&quot;
          field, provide a precise and descriptive definition of the attribute.
          This is probably the most important part of defining the attribute
          because it is where you provide information so that future viewers
          or users of the data can understand what the attribute means or represents.
          Next, choose the type of measurement scale for the data in the attribute
           in the &quot;Category&quot; section. Click &quot;Help&quot; for further explanation
          of
          each
          of
          these categories.
          Each measurement scale is also described below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Unordered (Nominal)</li>
        </ul>                        <p class="tablepanel">The unordered, or nominal,
          scale places values into named categories. The different values within
          a set are unordered.
          Text fields should be classified as nominal. Examples
          of unordered, or nominal,
          scales include gender (Male/Female) and marital status (single/married/divorced).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ordered (Ordinal)</li>
        </ul>        
        <p>The ordered, or ordinal, scale
          places values in a set order. All ordinal values are also nominal.
          Ordinal data show
          a particular value's position relative to other values, such as &quot;low,
          medium, high, etc.&quot; The ordinal scale doesn't indicate the distance
          between each item. Examples of ordered, or ordinal, scales include
          level of agreement (Strongly agree, Agree, Disagree, Strongly disagree),
          or
          age class
          (Adult, Sub-adult, Juvenile).</p>        <ul>
          <li>Relative (Interval)</li>
        </ul>                
          <p class="tablepanel">The relative, or interval, scale uses equal-sized
          units of measurement on a scale between values. It therefore allows
          the comparison of the differences between two values on the scale.
          With interval data, the allowable values start from an arbitrary point
          (not a meaningful zero), and so there is no concept of 'zero' of the
          measured quantity. Consequently, ratios of interval values are not
          meaningful. For example, one can not infer that someone with a value
          of 80 on an ecology test knows twice as much ecology as someone who
          scores 40 on the test, or that an object at 40 degrees C has twice
          the kinetic energy as an object at 20 degrees C. All interval values
          are also ordered and therefore are ordinal scale values as well. Example
            of  relative, or interval, scales include the celsius temperature
            scale and the fahrenheit temperature scale.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Absolute (Ratio)</li>
        </ul>        
        <p>The ratio scale is an interval scale with a meaningful zero point.
          The ratio scale begins at a true zero point that represents an absolute
          lack of the quality being measured. Thus, ratios of values are meaningful.
          For example, an object that is at elevation of 100 meters above sea
          level is twice as high as an object that is at an elevation of 50 meters
          above sea level (where sea level is the zero point). Also, an object
          at 300 degrees Kelvin has three times the kinetic energy of an object
          at 100 degrees Kelvin (where absolute zero (no motion) defines the
          zero point of the Kelvin scale). Interval values can often be converted
          to ratio values in order to make ratio comparisons legitimate. For
          example, an object at 40 degrees C is 313.15 degrees Kelvin, an object
          at 20 degrees C is 293.15 degrees Kelvin, and so the first object has
          approximately 1.07 times more kinetic energy (note the wrong answer
        you would have gotten had you taken the ratio of the values in Celsius).
          Examples of absolute, or ratio, scales include elevation, height, and
          the Kelvin temperature scale.</p>        <ul>
          <li>Date-Time</li>
          </ul>        
        <p>Date and time values in the Gregorian calendar are very strange to
          use in calculations in that they have properties of both interval and
          ratio scales. They also have some properties that do not conform to
          the interval scale because of the adjustments that are made to time
          to account for the variations in the period of the Earth around the
          sun (e.g. leap years). While the Gregorian calendar has a meaningful
          zero point, it would be difficult to say that a value taken on midnight
          January
          1,
          1000
          is twice as old as a value taken on midnight January 1 2000 because
          the scale has many irregularities in length in practice. However, over
          short intervals the scale has equidistant points based on the SI second,
          and so can be considered interval for some purposes, especially with
          respect to measuring the timing of short-term ecological events. Date
          and time values can be represented using several distinct notations,
          and so we have distinct documentation  needs in terms of specifying
          the format of the value representation. Because of these pragmatic
          issues,
          Date-Time has been separated into its own measurement scale. Examples
        of date-time values are '2003-05-05', '1999/10/10', and '2001-10-10T14:23:20.3'.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="tablepanel">It is important to keep in mind that a given type
          of data may fall under more than one of these categories because the
          categories are nested (i.e. ordinal data are also nominal, interval
          data are also ordinal and nominal, and ratio data are also interval,
          ordinal, and nominal). This may make choosing one category confusing,
          so remember to pick the category as low in the list as you can that
          still accurately describes the attribute's data.</p>
        <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="tablepanel">Choosing one of these five choices will bring about
          additional prompts, allowing you to describe the categories themselves,
          units, number types, and other details. You will encounter different
          screens depending on which category is chosen, and each of these screens
          is described and shown below. </p>        <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel"><a name="unordered"></a>Unordered (nominal)</p>          <p class="tablepanel">If &quot;Unordered&quot; is chosen, you will be first prompted
             to choose if the unordered categories are enumerated values
            belonging to a predefined list, or if they are text values (that
            are either free-form or that match a pattern). If you choose &quot;Enumerated
            values&quot;, you will be promoted to choose if the location of the enumerated
            values. If you choose &quot;Codes are defined here&quot;, you will see the
            screen pictured below. Click &quot;Add&quot; to add a code and its definition.
            For example, in your data table there may be values such as &quot;M&quot; and
            &quot;F&quot;, which stand for male and female, respectively. Therefore M and
            F would go under &quot;Code&quot;, and Male and Female would go under &quot;Definition&quot;
            in the table at the bottom of the screen.</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>          <p align="center" class="tablepanel"><img src="images/datawizard15.gif" width="647" height="554"></p>          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">Alternatively, you can choose to have the enumerated
            values (codes and their definitions)  imported from elsewhere,
            in which case you will see the screen pictured below. At the right
            of the screen there is a button labeled &quot;locate&quot; which allows you
            to tell the New Data Table Wizard where the enumerated codes list
            is located.</p>          
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>          <p align="center" class="tablepanel"><img src="images/datawizard16.gif" width="668" height="548"></p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">Clicking the &quot;locate&quot; button brings
            you to the screen pictured below. To import the codes later, choose
            the first
            option, &quot;Import the definitions table into Morpho later&quot;,
            and click
            &quot;OK&quot; at the bottom of the window.</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="tablepanel">Alternatively, if the codes
              and their definitions are already contained

            been included
            in
            this
              package&quot;. An example of what you will see when this second
              option is chosen is pictured below for a sample data table. Choose
              the
            two columns which contain the codes and their definitions by clicking
            the check boxes at the top of those columns, and then click
              &quot;OK&quot; at the bottom of the window. You will be returned
              to the screen pictured above and the selected codes and definitions
              will be displayed in the &quot;Definitions&quot; table.</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>          <p class="tablepanel">Note the check-box at the bottom of the screen.
            Check this box if your columns of data contain free-text, such as
            notes for example, in addition to the defined codes you provide in
          the &quot;Definitions&quot; table. Click &quot;OK&quot; when finished
          defining the attribute or column.</p>          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>          <p align="center" class="tablepanel"><font size="4"><img src="images/datawizard17.gif" width="673" height="450"></font></p>

          <p class="tablepanel">Another possibility is that the data in the attribute
            or column are unordered, but they are text values. In this case,
            choose &quot;Unordered&quot; from the &quot;Category&quot; list,
            and choose &quot;Text values
            (free-form or matching a pattern)&quot; from the drop-down menu next
            to
            &quot;Choose&quot;. Next, define the text values, and provide the
            name of their source, if applicable. You can also define the pattern
            of the text
            values by clicking &quot;Add&quot; at the bottom of the screen, and
            typing the pattern into the &quot;Pattern(s)&quot; table. You can
            then delete any patterns you would like using the &quot;Delete&quot; button.

          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>          <p align="center" class="tablepanel"><img src="images/datawizard19.gif" width="676" height="546"></p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">You also have the option of defining a new unit
            by clicking the &quot;Define new unit&quot; button located at the
            right of the screen. This option is described in the next paragraph.            </p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">To define a new unit, click on the button that
            says &quot;Define new unit&quot;. You will then see the screen pictured below.
            You can either type in the
              unit
              type
              in
              the
              first
              field, or
              use the
              drop down list to choose the unit type from a list. Next, click
            &quot;Add&quot;. You will see a drop-down list of unit types appear under &quot;Unit&quot;.
                The idea here is to construct your new unit by defining the units
              it is comprised of, and the power of each component unit in the
            new
              unit. As an example, consider the new unit to be of the type &quot;velocity&quot;.
              You would begin by choosing &quot;velocity&quot; under the Unit Type drop-down
              list. You would then click &quot;Add&quot; and choose &quot;Length&quot; from the drop
              down list found under &quot;Unit&quot;. The power of that unit would be 1.
              You would click &quot;Add&quot; again and choose &quot;Time&quot; from the drop-down
              list under &quot;Unit&quot;, and the power of that unit would be -1. Putting
              those two units together according to the indicated powers gives
              you a new unit of length/time. </p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>          <p align="center" class="tablepanel"><img src="images/datawizard20.gif" width="672" height="500"></p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">Next, you name the new unit. You also will specify
            the SI unit that corresponds to the new unit you have defined. If
            known, you can provide the conversion factor in the next field that
            would convert your unit to the SI unit. You can also provide a description
            of the new unit in the final field. Click &quot;OK&quot; at the bottom of the
            window when you are done defining your new unit.</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">After choosing or defining the unit, indicate
            the precision of the chosen or defined unit in the data by typing
            in the field next to &quot;Precision&quot;. Next, choose the number
            type
            of the
            data
            from the drop-down list. See the next paragraph for further explanation
            in choosing a number type. Finally, you can indicate the bounds of
            the values in the attribute or column
            at the
            bottom
            of
            the screen.
          Click &quot;Add&quot; to do this, and type in the indicated information.
          Use &quot;Delete&quot; to remove a set of bounds you entered.</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
          <p class="tablepanel">The four number types provided in the drop-down
            list are not discrete classes &#8211; some
            overlap, so choosing the appropriate number type can be confusing.
            Remember to choose the type that most specifically and accurately
          describes the data in the attribute or column you are defining.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Natural numbers</li>
          </ul>          
          <p>Natural numbers are positive and non-zero counting numbers (i.e.
                  non-fractions), such as 1, 2, 3, and so on. They cannot be
                negative or zero. When thinking of counting numbers, think about
                counting
                  a basket of oranges, or counting something using your fingers
                (although natural numbers can be larger than ten!). There are
                no fractions
                  of oranges or fractions of fingers (hopefully!), and there
                are no negative numbers of oranges or negative numbers of fingers.
              Natural numbers are one type of whole numbers.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Whole numbers</li>
          </ul>          <p>Whole numbers are just like natural numbers, except zero is included
                in the set of whole numbers, and therefore whole numbers are
                positive counting numbers and zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Just
                like natural
                numbers, they cannot be fractions or negative. Whole numbers
                are a type of integer, and they include natural numbers.</p>          
          <ul>
            <li>Integer numbers</li>
          </ul>          <p>Integers are just like whole numbers, except negative counting numbers
              are included in this set. Therefore integers are positive and negative
              counting numbers and zero, such as -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and
              so on. Just like whole and natural numbers they cannot be fractions.
              Integers are a type of rational numbers, and they include whole
              numbers and natural numbers.</p>          
          <ul>
            <li>Real numbers</li>
      </ul>                    <p>Real numbers are the broadest set of numbers. They can be negative
              and positive fractions and counting numbers, and can include zero.
              Therefore a list of numbers like the following would be a set of
              real numbers: -1/2, -0.25, 3.14, 0, 1, -25, 5/8, and so on.
              As you can see from this list of examples, real numbers include
              integers, whole numbers, and natural numbers.<br>

          <p>On the first screen of the New Data Table Wizard, you are given
            three choices under &quot;Where is your data?&quot;. If &quot;IMPORT&quot; is selected,

      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Under &quot;How do you want to enter the metadata description&quot;, there are
        two options. Automatic is where the documentation for the data table
        is automatically extracted from the table itself by Morpho, and is shown
        to you for review and editing, if necessary. Manual is where the documentation
        is entered manually by you in the wizard. After choosing one of these
        two options, tell the wizard where the data is that you would like to
        import by clicking on &quot;locate...&quot;. You will be shown a map of your computer
        and can indicate where the data file is. Click &quot;Next&quot; after choosing
        the file location.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If you chose to document the data manually, then you will follow the
        steps that were outlined previously under the &quot;Create&quot; section above
        (<a href="#fileformat">start here</a>). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><a name="automatic"></a>If you chose to document the
          data automatically, then clicking &quot;Next&quot; will being the screen pictured
          below into view. The screen includes some sample data shown for illustration
          purposes. Your data might look quite different.</p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="images/datawizard23.gif" width="655" height="568"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Begin by entering the name and a brief description of the data table.
        Indicate which row you would like the importation of data to start at
        (for example, you can skip some blank rows that may occur at the top
        of your data table by starting at a later row). If the first row that
        you start at contains the column labels, then click the box in the middle
        of the screen. Click &quot;Next&quot;. You will then see the screen pictured below.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center"><img src="images/datawizard24.gif" width="655" height="568"></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Select one or more of the delimiters listed at the top of the screen.
        Choosing different delimiters will change the layout of your data. The
        data should be laid out correctly when the correct delimiter or combination
        of delimiters is chosen. You may also indicate that consecutive delimiters
        be counted as one by checking the box. Clicking &quot;Next&quot; will begin the
        process of verifying the documentation that Morpho has automatically
        generated for each of the columns in the data table. The screen pictured
        below is an example of what you might see. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center"><img src="images/datawizard25.gif" width="739" height="548"></p>      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Another example is shown below. Note that Morpho automatically placed
        the codes in the table under &quot;Code&quot;, but you have to provide the
        definition of the codes. You must also provide definitions of the columns
        (Morpho does not do this automatically). Examine all
        of
        the
        other
        areas of
        documentation,
        making
        sure that the
        category, units, and all other documentation is correct. You may also
        add to the documentation or change anything that is in error by typing
        in the fields shown or choosing selections from the drop-down menus.
        Click &quot;Next&quot; at the bottom of the screen. Each screen provides
        the documentation for one of the attributes or columns of data. Continue
      in this way until all of the attributes or columns have been documented.</p>

      <p class="helpsub">Describe<a name="describe"></a></p>
      <p>On the first screen of the New Data Table Wizard, you are given three
        choices under &quot;Where is your data?&quot;. If &quot;DESCRIBE&quot; is chosen
        under &quot;Where is your data?&quot;, the data itself will not be included in
        the data package, but you will provide documentation
        for it. This is useful for documenting the data for yourself, as well
        as for telling others about the data if the data package is made viewable
        by others, without sharing the data itself. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>If &quot;DESCRIBE&quot; is selected,

        existing
          data file (without the data itself being extracted) for your review,
          then choose &quot;AUTOMATIC&quot;. You will then tell the Wizard where the data

        the row or column that is selected in the table, as well as delete selected
        rows or columns. This
        works
        much like the same functions in MIcrosoft Excel.</p>
      <ul><li>Editing Column Documentation</li>
      </ul>      
      <p align="left" class="tablepanel">In addition to manipulating the rows
        and columns, you can directly edit the documentation that you previously
        entered in the New Data Table Wizard, or add documentation, about the
        columns. After selecting the column for which you would like to edit
        the documentation, look under the &quot;Data&quot; menu, and select &quot;Edit Column
        Metadata&quot;. You will then see a 
        screen,
        pictured
        below for the second column of the sample data set, where the current
        documentation for the column is displayed. This screen works just like
        it did in the New Data Table Wizard (click <a href="#defineattribute">here</a> to
        revisit this section). You can edit or add to the documentation shown
        in this screen, and click OK when finished. </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Cut, Copy and Paste</li>
      </ul>      
      <p>Cut, copy, and paste, which can be accessed under the &quot;Edit&quot; menu (pictured
        below) work in Morpho just like they do in Microsoft applications like
        Word and Excel. Shortcut keys on your keyboard can also be used just
        like in Microsoft applications (Ctrl+X cuts, Ctrl+V pastes, and Ctrl+C
        copies). You can relocate or delete rows and columns using these tools.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>      <p align="center"><img src="images/manipulatedata4.gif" width="734" height="474"></p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left">Another option is to paste data into a data table in Morpho
        from elsewhere, so that you don't have to type it in. This is easy to
        do, and generally involves using the &quot;Paste&quot; command in Morpho. Click
        <a href="Morpho_FAQs.html#pastedata">here</a> to read more about pasting data into a data table. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reverting (undoing changes)</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="left" class="tablepanel">If you change your mind about any of
        the changes you have made to one or more tables in your data package,
        you can undo these changes (as long as you have not saved the data package
        since making the changes). Under the &quot;Edit&quot; menu, choosing &quot;Revert Tab&quot;
        will cause all changes that have been made on the table that is displayed
        since the last time you saved the data package to be reversed. Choosing
        &quot;Revert All Tabs&quot; causes all changes that have been made to all of the
        tables in the data package since the last time you saved the data package
        to be reversed. The location of these two tools is shown in the screen
        above.</p>
