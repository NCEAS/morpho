          one attribute is required to be defined, but it is highly recommended
          that ALL attributes be defined. Click &quot;Add&quot; to define one of the attributes.

          label for the attribute (which should be shorter than the name of the
            attribute). In the &quot;Definition&quot; field, provide a precise and descriptive
            definition of the attribute. This is probably the most important
            part of defining
          the attribute because it is where you provide information so that future
          viewers or users of the data can understand what the attribute means
          or represents. </p>
        <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="tablepanel">Next, choose the type of measurement
              scale for the attribute's data in the &quot;Category&quot; section.  Each measurement
              scale is
              described below.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#unordered">Unordered (Nominal)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tablepanel">The unordered, or nominal, scale
            places values into named categories. The different values within
            a set are unordered.
          Most text fields should be classified as nominal. Examples of unordered,
          or nominal, scales include gender (Male/Female) and marital status
          (single/married/divorced). </p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#ordered">Ordered (Ordinal)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ordered, or ordinal, scale places values in a
            set order. All ordinal values are also nominal. Ordinal data show
            a particular value's position
          relative to other values, such as &quot;low, medium, high, etc.&quot; The ordinal
          scale does not indicate the distance between each item. Examples of
          ordered, or ordinal, scales include level of agreement (Strongly agree,
          Agree, Disagree, Strongly disagree), or age class (Adult, Sub-adult,
          Juvenile).</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#relative">Relative (Interval)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p class="tablepanel">The relative, or interval, scale
            uses equal-sized units of measurement between values on a scale.
            It therefore allows the comparison of the differences between two
            values on the scale.
          With interval data, the allowable values start from an arbitrary point
          (not a meaningful zero), and so there is no concept of 'zero' of the
          measured quantity. Consequently, ratios of interval values are not
          meaningful. This is the main difference between the relative (interval)
            scale and the absolute (ratio) scale. For example, using the relative
            (interval) scale, one can not infer that someone with a value of
            80 on an ecology test
            knows
            twice
            as
            much
            ecology
            as someone
            who
          scores 40 on the test, or that an object at 40 degrees C has twice
          the kinetic energy as an object at 20 degrees C. All interval
            values are also ordered and therefore are ordinal scale values as
            well. Example
          of relative, or interval, scales include the celsius temperature scale
          and the fahrenheit temperature scale.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#absolute">Absolute (Ratio)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The ratio scale is an interval scale with a meaningful zero point.
          The ratio scale begins at a true zero point that represents an absolute
          lack of the quality being measured. Thus, ratios of values are meaningful.
          For example, an object that is at elevation of 100 meters above sea
          level is twice as high as an object that is at an elevation of 50 meters
          above sea level (where sea level is the zero point). Also, an object
          at 300 degrees Kelvin has three times the kinetic energy of an object
          at 100 degrees Kelvin (where absolute zero (no motion) defines the
          zero point of the Kelvin scale). Interval values can often be converted
          to ratio values in order to make ratio comparisons legitimate. For
          example, an object at 40 degrees C is 313.15 degrees Kelvin, an object
          at 20 degrees C is 293.15 degrees Kelvin, and so the first object has
          approximately 1.07 times more kinetic energy (note the wrong answer
          you would have gotten had you taken the ratio of the values in Celsius).
          Examples of absolute, or ratio, scales include elevation, height, and
          the Kelvin temperature scale.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="#datetime">Date-Time</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Date and time values in the Gregorian calendar are
            very strange to use in calculations in that they have properties
            of both interval and
          ratio scales. They also have some properties that do not conform to
          the interval scale because of the adjustments that are made to time
          to account for the variations in the period of the Earth around the
          sun (e.g. leap years). While the Gregorian calendar has a meaningful
          zero point, it would be difficult to say that a value taken on midnight
          January 1, 1000 is twice as old as a value taken on midnight January
          1, 2000 because the scale has many irregularities in length in practice.
          However, over short intervals the scale has equidistant points based
          on the SI second, and so can be considered interval for some purposes,
          especially with respect to measuring the timing of short-term ecological
          events. Date and time values can be represented using several distinct
          notations, and so we have distinct documentation needs in terms of
          specifying the format of the value representation. Because of these
          pragmatic issues, Date-Time has been separated into its own measurement
          scale. Examples of date-time values are '2003-05-05', '1999/10/10',
      and '2001-10-10T14:23:20.3'.</p>

              idea  is to construct your new unit by defining the units it is
              comprised of, and the power of each component unit in the new unit.
              As an example, consider the new unit to be of the type &quot;Speed&quot;.
              You would begin by choosing &quot;Speed&quot; under the Unit Type drop-down
              list. You would then click &quot;Add&quot; and choose &quot;Length&quot; from the drop-down list found under &quot;Unit&quot;. The power of that unit would be 1. You
              would click &quot;Add&quot; again and choose &quot;Time&quot; from the drop-down list under &quot;Unit&quot;,
              and the power of that unit would be -1. Putting those two units together
        according to the indicated powers gives you a new unit of length/time. </p>
        <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="tablepanel" align="left">Next, you name the new unit. You also will specify the SI unit that corresponds to the new unit you have defined. If known, you can provide the conversion factor in the next field that would convert your unit to the SI unit. You can also provide a description of the new unit in the final field. Click &quot;OK&quot; at the bottom of the window when you are done defining your new unit.</p>

        <p class="tablepanel">&nbsp;</p>
        <p class="tablepanel">After choosing or defining the
            unit, indicate the precision of the chosen or defined unit in the
            data by typing in the
          field next to &quot;Precision&quot;. Next, choose the number type of the data
          from the drop-down list. See the next paragraph for further explanation
          in choosing a number type. Finally, you can indicate the bounds of
          the values in the attribute or column at the bottom of the screen.
          Click &quot;Add&quot; to do this, and type in the indicated information. Use &quot;Delete&quot; to

        <p class="tablepanel">The four number types provided
            in the drop-down list are not discrete classes &#8211; some overlap,
            so choosing the appropriate number type can be confusing. Remember
            to choose the type
          that most specifically and accurately describes the data in the attribute
          or column you are defining.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Natural numbers: Natural numbers are positive and non-zero counting
            numbers (i.e. non-fractions), such as 1, 2, 3, and so on. They cannot
            be negative or zero. When thinking
          of counting numbers, think about counting a basket of oranges, or counting
          something using your fingers (although natural numbers can be larger
          than ten!). There are no fractions of oranges or fractions of fingers
          (hopefully!), and there are no negative numbers of oranges or negative
          numbers of fingers. Natural numbers are one type of whole numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Whole numbers: Whole numbers are just like natural numbers, except
            zero is included in the set of whole numbers, and therefore whole
            numbers are positive
          counting numbers and zero: 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on. Just like natural
          numbers, they cannot be fractions or negative. Whole numbers are a
          type of integer, and they include natural numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Integer numbers: Integers are just like whole numbers, except negative
            counting numbers are included in this set. Therefore integers are
            positive and negative
          counting numbers and zero, such as -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on.
          Just like whole and natural numbers they cannot be fractions. Integers
          are a type of rational numbers, and they include whole numbers and
          natural numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>Real numbers: Real numbers are the broadest set of numbers. They
            can be negative and positive fractions and counting numbers, and
            can include zero.
          Therefore a list of numbers like the following would be a set of real
          numbers: -1/2, -0.25, 3.14, 0, 1, -25, 5/8, and so on. As you can see
          from this list of examples, real numbers include integers, whole numbers,
      and natural numbers.</li>

          the documentation, look under the &quot;Data&quot; menu, and select &quot;Edit Column
          Documentation&quot;. You will then see a screen, pictured below for the second
          column of the sample data set, where the current documentation for
          the column is displayed. This screen works just like it did in the
          New Data Table Wizard (click <a href="#defineattribute">here</a> to
          revisit this section). You can edit or add to the documentation shown
          in this screen, and click OK when finished. </p>

          (pictured below) work in Morpho just like they do in Microsoft applications
          like Word and Excel. Shortcut keys on your keyboard can also be used
          just like in Microsoft applications (Ctrl+X cuts, Ctrl+V pastes, and
          Ctrl+C copies). You can relocate or delete rows and columns using these
          tools.</p>

            you change your mind about any of the changes you have made to one
            or more tables in your data package,
          you can undo these changes (as long as you have not saved the data
          package since making the changes). Under the &quot;Edit&quot; menu, choosing &quot;Revert
          Entity to Saved Version &quot; will cause all changes that have been made on the table that is
          displayed since the last time you saved the data package to be reversed.
          Choosing &quot;Revert All Entities to Saved Version &quot; causes all changes that have been made to
          all of the tables in the data package since the last time you saved
          the data package to be reversed. The location of these two tools is
