/**
 * Parses the Netscape bookmarks file (NETSCAPE-Bookmark-file-1) into
 * BookmarkEntries's and BookmarkDirectories.
 * <p>
 * For the time being, this is a hack, there needs to be a more generic
 * API to this to allow adding/removing bookmarks and pulling from 
 * different sources other than just Netscape. But for this example, this is
 * plenty good.
 * <p>While a hack, this is interesting in that it shows how you can use
 * the parser provided in the javax.swing.text.html.parser package outside
 * of the HTML package. The netscape format is a pseudo HTML file, pseudo
 * in that there is no head/body. All the bookmarks are presented as
 * DT's in a DL and the name of the directory is a DT. An instance of the
 * parser is created, a callback is registered, and as the parser parses
 * the file, nodes of the correct type are created.
