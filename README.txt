TopFrame.java is the 'top-level' class of the application. i.e. to launch use the command

java -cp .;xerces.jar;xalan.jar edu.ucsb.nceas.dtclient.TopFrame

The two jar files xalan.jar, and xerces.jar are required for the application to run. xerces and xalan jar files can be downloaded from http://xml.apache.org/    

images should be placed in the same directory as class files
