This is a BETA version of the Morpho client tool. It is known to be incomplete
and to have a number of bugs. It is being released simply for preliminary
review. 

It is almost a complete change from previous versions - thus, previous help 
documentation is NOT applicable. 

Morpho is a Java application. One thus needs to have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
installed on the machine running Morpho. You can see if a JVM is installed by
typing 'java' on the command line and seeing if any messages appear. If Java is
not installed, a Java runtime system can be downloaded from Sun at
"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre"


If Java is properly installed, you should be able to start Morpho by simply
executing the 'morpho.bat' file in Windows or the 'morpho' script on Linux.

The Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity (KNB)
---------------------------------------------
Morpho is one of a series of tools that are being built for the KNB in order
to make ecological data and metadata more accessible and useful to scientists.
In particular, the KNB has a distributed metadata catalog called Metacat.
Morpho can be used to contribute data and metadata to the KNB and make it
accessible in the Metacat system.  To do so, one must have an account on
the KNB, which can be obtained for testing purposes by writing to
"knb-software@nceas.ucsb.edu".

See the KNB website (http://knb.ecoinformatics.org/software) for more information and
other software tools.
