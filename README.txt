This is a ALPHA version of the Morpho client tool. It is known to be incomplete
and to have a number of 'bugs'. It is being released simply for preliminary
review. 

It is almost a complete change from previous versions - thus, previous help 
documentation is NOT applicable. 

Morpho is a Java application. One thus needs to have a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
installed on the machine running Morpho. You can see if a JVM is installed by
typing 'java' on the command line and seeing if any messages appear. If Java is
not installed, a Java runtime system can be downloaded from Sun at
"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/jre"

The current version of Morpho has only been tested on Windows and Linux OSs using 
Java version 1.3. It is not expected to run on Macs that do not have OS X (and it
has not been tested even on OS X machines).

If Java is properly installed, you should be able to start Morpho by simply
executing the 'morpho.bat' file in Windows or the 'morpho' script on Linux.
